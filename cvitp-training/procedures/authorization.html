  <p><strong>Signing form TIS60 in  virtual clinics</strong></p>
	
  <p>Only  if you are participating in a free virtual clinic can you get an individual&rsquo;s verbal  consent instead of signing Section I of the TIS60. Additionally, for verbal  consent you must ensure the individual is aware of and agrees to the following  conditions: </p>
  <div>
    <div> </div>
  </div>
<ol>
  <li>You are a volunteer under the  CVITP and not acting as an agent of the Canada Revenue Agency 
<details>
  <summary>Read the script to the individual: </summary>
  <p> Hello,  my name is (insert name). I&rsquo;m a volunteer from the Community Volunteer Income  Tax Program. I will prepare your income tax and benefits return(s)  electronically for you with the information you supplied. </p>
  <p> I  am a volunteer with (organization name) here to provide this service to you. I  am not an employee of the Canada Revenue Agency. </p>
  <p> Do  I have your permission to complete and file your income tax return? </p>
	  </details>	
    </li>
    <li>The method(s) of communication may  potentially be unsecure 
<details>
  <summary>Read the script to the individual: </summary>
  <p>We will be discussing your  personal information so that I may prepare your tax return. I have and will  continue to take all reasonable efforts to ensure information is kept safe,  however, the method of communication we are using may not be secure. </p>
  <p>Regarding  use of cell phone, video or email:</p>
  <p> Do you consent to the use of a <strong>cell phone or cordless telephone</strong> to  discuss information needed to prepare your income tax and benefits return(s)? </p>
  <p>Do you consent to the use of <strong>videoconference</strong> (insert name of  application) to discuss information needed to prepare your income tax and  benefits return(s)?</p>
  <p>Do you consent to the use of <strong>unsecure email</strong> to exchange written  discussions, communication and documents needed to prepare your income tax and  benefits return(s)? </p>
	</details>
    </li>
    <li>Service will not be provided if the  individual chooses to discontinue the call 
  <details>
  <summary>Read the script to the individual: </summary>
  <p>You may choose to discontinue this  call at any time. If you choose to do so, or fail to provide the information needed  to prepare your tax return, I will not be able to assist you.</p>
    <p>Do you acknowledge what I just  read to you?</p>
	  </details>
    </li>	
	</ol>
  <p>Once you receive verbal consent, Section I – Authorization of the  TIS60 is considered completed.</p>

  <h2 id="h2">Organizing slips and receipts </h2>
  <p>You may consider organizing  the slips and receipts as they apply to the different sections of the income tax  return to save time and reduce errors. For example, keeping all T4 slips  together makes them easier to find when entering employment income information into  the tax software.</p>
<p> The most common  information slips and receipts may include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>T4, T5, T5007, T4AA and  T4(OAS)</li>
    <li>receipts for child care, medical expenses, and RRSP  contributions</li>
    <li>charitable donation receipts, including those made  in the current year and any donations made and not claimed within the last five  years</li>
    <li>tuition receipts, such as T2202, TL11A, or TL11B</li>
  </ul>
<h2 id="h3">Verifying the information on the slips and receipts</h2> 			 
  <p>Confirm the accuracy of the information reported  on the slips (for example, name, SIN, and issuer) with the individual. If a  slip has inaccurate information, the individual must contact the issuer of the  slip to have it corrected. Individuals&nbsp;waiting for a slip issue to be  resolved are still encouraged to have their tax return prepared before the  deadline. This will ensure there are no interruptions to any benefit or credit  payments they may be entitled to, and help avoid late-filing penalties. </p>
  <p>If an individual is missing a slip, you can obtain their  information by:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>using Auto-fill my return or sign into Represent a  client for the individual</li>
    <li>calling the dedicated help line for volunteers  at&nbsp;1-866-398-3488 </li>
    <li>asking the individual to contact their employer or  payer</li>
    <li>using pay stubs or statements to estimate the missing  income and deductions</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="h5 mrgn-tp-sm">Note</h3>	
  <p>If you are calling the dedicated help line for  volunteers to obtain missing information, you need to obtain the individual&rsquo;s authorization.</p>
  <details>
  <summary>This needs a label</summary>	  
  <ul>
    <li>If  the individual has authorized you to use the <strong>Auto-fill my return</strong> service to prepare their tax return you may call the dedicated help line for  missing information on the  same calendar  day the authorization was made.</li>
    <li>If the  individual has not authorized use of the <strong>Auto-file my return</strong> service then they need to be present while you make the call to speak directly  with the telephone agent to answer some confidentiality questions. Once  confidentiality is met, the individual can provide the telephone agent with  verbal authorization for you to speak on their behalf for the duration of that  telephone call.  </li>
  </ul>

<h2 id="h4">Questions to ask the individual</h2>
<p>The following list includes  suggested questions you can ask the individual to ensure you have all the  information needed to prepare their tax return: </p>
<ul>
  <li>How       many tax years do you need me to prepare for you? For which years?</li>
  <li>Do       you have any family members, such as a spouse or common-law partner, who       must also prepare their tax return?</li>
  <li>Do       you have children or other <a href="../glossary.html#dependants">dependants</a>? How many? What are their ages?</li>
  <li>Have       you, your spouse or dependant(s) (if applicable) been approved for the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/community-volunteer-income-tax-program/lend-a-hand-individuals/training-volunteers/scenarios/disabilities.html" target="_blank">T2201, Disability Tax Credit Certificate</a>?</li>
  <li>How       many sources of income did you have this year? For example, multiple       employers and interest income.</li>
  <li>Has       your living situation changed within the last year? This may include a       change in marital status, address, or dependants (custody change,       adoption, additional dependants)?</li>
  <li>Did       you earn any tips?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you know or suspect that the  information an individual provides to you is not accurate or contains  omissions, withdraw your services.</p>
