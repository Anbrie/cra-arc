  <h2 id="h-1">Overview</h2>
  <p>This  lesson will help students learn what to expect when they start a new job and  the tax information they should be aware of. Students will be able to test  their knowledge through quizzes and practical examples.</p>
  <p>The <strong>core questions</strong> are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>What  personal information and tax information do I need to start a job?</li>
    <li>What  does my employer take care of in terms of my taxes?</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Learning objective:</strong> Students  will develop an understanding of what is required to start working in Canada.  They will also learn what payroll deductions are and how they are calculated.  As a result, they will be better able to grasp how they pay income tax and  contribute to social programs through employment.</p>
  <p>The <strong>time frame</strong> to complete this lesson is X.</p>
  <h2 id="h-2">Skills to develop</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Identify  the need for a social insurance number</li>
    <li>Explain  the purpose of a TD1, Personal Tax Credits Return</li>
    <li>Describe  why deductions are taken from their pay</li>
    <li>Make  connections between their bi-weekly pay, social programs, and their tax return</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="h-3">Background</h2>
  <p>85% of Canadians work as employees rather than  being self employed or running a business. In Canada's tax system, employers  will take income tax and other contributions to social programs directly off  their employee's pay. The contributions to social programs are based on a  predefined percentage of the employee's income, whereas the income tax deducted  at source is based on the information the employee gives on the TD1 form.</p>
  <p>These  social programs include: </p>

      <h4>First exercise</h4>
      <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Explain  to students that whether they are starting their first job or have been working  for many years, the basic parts of starting a new job do not change. </p>
      <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Ask students if they have already worked for an employer or a company rather than  odd jobs such as babysitting. For those that answer yes, ask what they remember  about being hired, related to getting paid.</p>
      <div class="mrgn-lft-md">
        <p>Suggested answers could be:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Providing their social insurance number</li>
          <li>Filling out tax forms</li>
          <li>Giving their banking information for direct deposit</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <h4>Second exercise</h4>
      <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Inform  students that one of the most common taxes we pay in Canada is income tax. For most  individuals, their employer takes this directly off their pay. This is known as  a payroll deduction.</p>
      <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Ask students if they know of any other amounts  that are deducted from their pay.</p>
      <div class="mrgn-lft-md">
        <p>Suggested answers could be:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>CPP/QPP contributions</li>
          <li>EI premiums</li>
          <li>Quebec Parental Insurance Plan (QPIP) premiums</li>
          <li>Union dues</li>
          <li>Health plan premiums</li>
          <li>Private pension plan contributions</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="well brdr-rds-0">
        <h4>Activity</h4>
        <p>Ask students why they think payroll deductions are important. Give them a few minutes to write down why they think payroll deductions are important. Ask them to keep these in mind as they review the next following lesson activities.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="lst-stps-itm">
      <h3 id="h-4-3">Walk through the lessons<span class="wb-inv"> step 3</span></h3>
      <p>Read  through the lesson pages with the additional guidance provided below. Students  can review material individually, in groups, or as a class.</p>
      <h4>Lesson A: Why you need a SIN or  tax number</h4>
      <h5>Before starting the lesson</h5>
      <p>Advise  students that all individuals in Canada require a SIN to work or to get  benefits and services from the government. Depending on their residency status  and their citizenship status, they may receive a permanent or a temporary SIN. An  individual's SIN usually stays with them indefinitely. </p>
      <h5>After finishing the lesson</h5>
      <p>Stress to students the importance of keeping  their SIN safe. Discuss the consequences of a compromised SIN, such as fraud or  identity theft, and the long-term impacts this can have. </p>
      <h4>Lesson B: When to fill out a TD1,  Personal Tax Credits Return</h4>
      <h5>Before starting the lesson</h5>
      <p>Inform  students that they will need to complete a TD1 form whenever they start a new  job. As discussed previously, their employer will take income tax off their  pay. Their answers on their TD1 form allow their employer to complete this  calculation accurately based on their personal tax situation</p>
      <h5>After finishing the lesson</h5>
      <p>Explain  that, in Canada, individuals do their taxes to calculate the income tax they  owe on their income. They use information like their taxable income and the tax  credits they're entitled to. Their employer will, ideally, withhold enough tax  to cover the taxes they owe on their income at the end of the year. This is why  it's important to complete the TD1 form accurately: to make sure that the  correct amount of tax is withheld – no more, no less. </p>
      <div class="well brdr-rds-0">
        <h5>Activity</h5>
        <p>Display  the federal TD1 form to the class and review the list of personal tax credits  that can be claimed. Ask students which tax credits they think they might be  able to claim, either now or in the future. </p>
      </div>
      <h4>Lesson C: What's on your pay  stub</h4>
      <h5>Before starting the lesson</h5>
      <p>Discuss  the concept of payroll with students. Explain that their employer will first  calculate their pay based on the hours they work and their wage, and will then  calculate what amounts to take off. </p>
      <p>As  previously mentioned, the most common deduction is income tax, which is  calculated based on the employee's income and the TD1 form they submit. </p>
      <p>Their  employer will also deduct other amounts, such as CPP/QPP contributions and EI  premiums. These amounts are a pre-determined percentage of the employee's income.  Advise that their employer will make a matching contribution to these programs  on their behalf.</p>
      <h5>After finishing the lesson</h5>
      <p>Ask  students to look back at the notes they took during the warm up exercise about  payroll deductions, and to compare them to what they learned in the <strong>Understanding your pay stub </strong>video. Ask  them to share some of their ideas about why payroll deductions are important. </p>
      <p>Inform  them that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>their  contributions to social programs make these programs possible and help fund  future payments they may receive from these programs</li>
        <li>they  can also claim tax credits for these amounts when they do their taxes</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Ask  students what would happen if their employer did not take income tax off their  pay, and what this might mean for individuals earning income through odd jobs that  do not have tax automatically deducted, such as babysitting or mowing the lawn.  Inform them that they would calculate the full amount of taxes they owe on  their income when they do their taxes. This results in a large balance owing at  once instead of paying it gradually over the course of the year.</p>
      <h4>Lesson D: What's on your T4</h4>
      <h5>Before starting the lesson</h5>
      <p>Advise  students that the T4 slip is one of the most common documents they will use  when they do their taxes. It gives a history of their employment income and  deductions for the entire year, similar to the year-to-date information found  on their pay stub. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="lst-stps-itm">
      <h3 id="h-4-4">Bring it all together<span class="wb-inv"> step 4</span></h3>
      <p>Direct  students to complete the quiz to assess their understanding. </p>
      <p>Discuss  the connection between their employment earnings and the tax return. </p>
      <p>When  they do their taxes every year, they will: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use  their SIN to identify themselves with the CRA when they do their taxes</li>
        <li>Have  the option of claiming the tax credits shown on the TD1 form on their tax  return </li>
        <li>Use  their pay stubs to confirm the accuracy of their T4 slip</li>
        <li>Use  their T4 to report their earnings when they do their taxes</li>
        <li>Report  the employment income they earned, as the taxes that they may owe are  calculated using their income</li>
        <li>Claim  tax credits for certain payroll deductions, such as CPP/QPP contributions and  EI premiums, to help lower the taxes they owe </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Reconfirm  that the information learned will be useful to students when they start to work  in Canada; but, the same concepts will still apply when they do their taxes  each year.</p>
