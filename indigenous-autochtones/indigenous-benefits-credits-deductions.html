	<summary>Notes on this page</summary>
<p>This sub-page to the main Indigenous tax benefits page gives additional details about particular benefits, credits and deductions that might particular be of interest to or apply to Indigenous people. The parent page refers generally to the benefits and notes that you get some benefits if you file a tax return, even if you don't have taxable income. This page goes into more detail on the benefits themselves. </p>
<p>This is focused on benefits related to your taxes. That makes sense for the Disability tax credit, because it's a deduction off your income taxes. But even though the GST/HST credit is related to taxes, it's just cash you get. The Canada child benefit has no apparent connection to taxes. The key thing though, is that you can get them if you file your taxes.</p>
<p>Therefore, this content needs to not assume that people have any such understanding, or see any distinction between this and the sorts of things on the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/audience/indigenous.html">Benefits for indigeous peoples</a> page.</p>
<p>Finally, we have to modify the main Indigenous page content and possibly title to allow this to be a page that focuses on the benefits, credits and deductions, and that parent page to be more about taxes in general, if that is what's appropriate.</p>
