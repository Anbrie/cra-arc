<h2 id="h-2">Give the forms to your employee</h2>
 <details> <summary>Electronic TD1 Forms you created</summary>
<p>You may create a federal and/or provincial or territorial Form TD1, Personal Tax Credits Return, and have your employee send it to you electronically instead of giving paper copies of Form TD1 to your employees.</p>

<p>The following conditions must be met:</p> 
<ul><li>You can create, maintain and store the TD1 Personal Tax Credits Return forms electronically.</li>
<li>Security measures must be in place to authenticate the employee's identity because there is no written signature on the TD1 Form (for example, a password system or an employee self-service portal).</li></ul>
<p>In addition to the above conditions, the electronic forms must:</p>

<ul>
<li>be made available and accessible to the CRA when requested and be maintained in a format that can be read by representatives of the CRA. </li>
<li>mirrors the CRA approved TD1 paper form </li>
<li>include a certification confirming that the information given by the employee is accurate. For example, clicking on a button saying "I agree" to a statement that is similar to the certification statement on the paper Form TD1 return (i.e. the information is correct and complete to the best of his or her knowledge) </li>
<li>be in a format that cannot be altered. In other words changes can only be made if your employee submits a new Form TD1 </li>
<li>include a date so you can tell when your employee submits a new Form TD1 to you </li>
<li>meets all of the CRA's general guidelines on record retention and on electronic records, which can be found in information circular <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/ic78-10.html">IC78-10R, Books and Records Retention/Destruction</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>The use of the electronic form will not relieve you of your responsibility to review the completed forms for reasonableness. </p>

 <h2 id="h-3">Tips for employers when providing the forms</h2>

<p>You may need to get <strong>additional information</strong> from your employee depending on the employment situation.</p>
<details>
<summary>Situation: Employee lives in one province but works in another</span></summary>
<p>If your employee lives in one province but works in another, they may be subject to excessive or insufficient tax deductions. Your employee can ask for a reduction in tax deductions by obtaining a <strong>letter of authority </strong>from any TSO or request additional tax to be withheld on their <strong>federal </strong>TD1 form.</p>
<p>Learn more: <a href="changes.html">Make changes to employee information</a>.</p>

		 </details>
<details>
<summary>Situation: Employee is a working part-time</span></summary>
<p>You may recommend to your part-time employees that it could be beneficial to have more income tax deducted from the remuneration they receive. Your employee may avoid having to pay a large amount of tax when they file their income tax and benefit return. This may happen if they work part-time for different employers during the year.</p>
		 </details>

<details>
<summary>Situation: Employee want's to reduce the amount of tax to be deducted</span></summary>
<p>You may recommend to your employee to get a letter of authority from CRA to reduce the amount of tax you will be deducting. Examples of when employees may request a reduction in tax deductions:</p>

<ul>
<li>employee makes charitable donations to registered charities or other qualified donees </li>
<li>employee has employment-related expenses </li>
<li>employee pays for child care </li>
<li>employee makes deductible RRSP contributions himself during the year </li>
<li>employee lives in one province or territory but works in another and will have too much tax deducted </li>
</ul>

</details>
<details>
<summary>Situation: Employee is a pensionner</span></summary>
		 </details>



 <h2 id="h-4">What if you do not receive the form</h2>

<p>If an employee does not give you their Form TD1, the employee's tax deductions will only include the basic personal amount you estimated bases on their income. You still need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Determine which tax tables to use </li>
<li>Calculate deductions and remit them by the due date </li></ul>
<h3>Penalties</h3>
<p>If your employees does provide you with a form, they may be penalized $25 for each day the form is late. The minimum penalty is $100, and increases by $25 per day to the maximum of $2,500.</p>


<h2 id="h-5">After receiving the forms</h2>
<p>You need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>review the back of the TD1 form to make sure your employee has not included any <strong>additional </strong>information (for example, requesting additional tax to be deducted). </li>
<li>review the back of the TD1 form to make sure the box <strong>More than one employer or payer at the same time </strong>is not checked. If the box is checked and the employees' total income from all sources will be <strong>more </strong>than the personal tax credits claimed on another TD1 form, you must enter <strong>zero </strong>on the <strong>Total Claim Amount </strong>line. This is because employees with multiple employers cannot claim the basic personal amount with more than <strong>one </strong>employer <strong>unless </strong>their combined annual earnings will be <strong>less </strong>than the basic personal amount </li>
<li>use the <strong>Total Claim Amount </strong>from the TD1 form to calculate the correct amount of federal and provincial or territorial income tax deductions </li>
<li>keep the completed forms with your employee's records. <strong>Do not </strong>send us a copy. </li>
<li>determine which tax tables to use </li>
<li>calculate deductions and remit them by the due date </li>
</ul>

<p>A new form will be required within <strong>seven days </strong>of any changes to your employee's personal tax credits. </p>
<h3>Your responsibility</h3>
<p>It is a serious offence to knowingly accept a TD1 that contains false or deceptive statements. If you think that the TD1 has false information, you should ask for proof from your employee such as proof of age and/or address If you think that the TD1 has false information, you must deduct taxes after allowing the basic personal amount <strong>only</strong>.</p>
