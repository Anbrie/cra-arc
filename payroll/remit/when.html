<h1 property="name" id="wb-cont" class="gc-thickline">When to remit (pay)</h1>
<p>Your remitter type sets your remitting frequency and affects your due dates. Generally, it is based on your average monthly withholding amount (AMWA) from two calendar years ago. The due dates apply both to:</p>

<ul>
<li>remitting periods when you <strong>pay or give remuneration</strong> </li>
<li>reporting a <strong>nil remittance </strong>when you have seasonal workers or no employees </li>
</ul>
<details><summary>Find out about different remitter types </summary>
<h3 id="h_1_1">What is the average monthly withholding amount (AMWA) and monthly withholding amount (MWA)</h3>
<p>The Average monthly withholding amount (AMWA) is the total of all required payroll deduction remittances in a calendar year divided by the number of <strong>months </strong>(maximum 12) that required a payroll deduction remittance in that calendar year.</p>
<p>The Monthly withholding amount (MWA) is the total of all required remittances in one calendar month.</p>
<p>Every November, the CRA conducts a review of all payroll deduction accounts to determine remitter types.</p>
<p>If your remitter type changes, it will let you know in writing. If applicable, the CRA will also look at your compliance history to see if you qualify as a quarterly remitter.</p>
<h3>Remitter type vs pay periods</h3>
<p>Your remitter type is not related to your pay periods. If your remitter type changes, you do not have to start paying your employees more often because you have to remit on different due dates.</p>
<h3>More than one RP account</h3>
<p>If your organization has more than one payroll program (RP) account, your remitter type will be the same for all accounts.</p>
<h3>Associated corporations</h3>
<p>If you are an associated corporation, your remitter type is the same as that of all your associated corporations.</p>

<details><summary>Example 1 - Regular corporation</summary> 

<p>In 2019, Company A had to remit $1,050,000 over 10 months. It is not an associated corporation. Company A's AMWA is calculated as follows: $1,050,000 ÷ 10 = $105,000.</p>
<p>Since its AMWA was over $99,999.99 in 2019, Company A will be a threshold 2 accelerated remitter for 2021.</p>
</details>
<details><summary> Example 2 - Associated corporation</summary> 
<p>Companies X and Y are associated corporations. In 2019, their combined source deductions remittances were $297,000. Each corporation had to remit for January through November. Since months are counted only once, their AMWA is calculated as follows: $297,000 ÷ 11 = $27,000.</p>
<p>Since their combined AMWA was between $25,000.00 and $99,999.99 in 2019, each company will be a threshold 1 accelerated remitter for 2021.</p>
<p>Quarterly remitters: new small employers</p>
</details>
<h3 id="h_1_2">Remitter types</h3>
<h4>Quarterly remitters - New small employers</h4>
<p>A new employer is an employer whose payroll deduction account has been open for less than <strong>12 months</strong>.</p>
<p>New employers are eligible to be a quarterly remitter if they meet <strong>both </strong>of the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
<li>the MWA is less than <strong>$1,000</strong> </li>
<li>a perfect compliance record is maintained on all payroll and GST/HST program accounts. </li>
</ul>
<p>A new employer who no longer qualifies to be a quarterly remitter will be considered a regular remitter in the <strong>next </strong>calendar quarter.</p>
<h5>MWA condition is not met</h5>
<p>Zach's Auto Repairs has a MWA of $500 for January, $1,500 for February, and $1,500 for March. The employer's quarterly remittance of $3,500 is due by April 15. Because the MWA for February and March was $1,000 or more, the employer will have to remit monthly beginning with their MWA for the month of April, which is due by May 15.</p>
<h5>Perfect compliance history condition is not met</h5>
<p>ABC Construction has a MWA of $500 for each of the months January, February and March. If April 15 is a Saturday, Monday April 17 is a public holiday recognized by the CRA, and the employer remits their quarterly remittance of $1,500 after April 18, the remittance is considered late. Because the failure happened in April, ABC Construction may make their quarterly remittance for April, May and June by July 15. However, the company will have to remit monthly beginning with their MWA for the month of July, which is due by August 15.</p>
<h5>Perfect compliance record</h5>
<p>Quarterly remitters <strong>must </strong>meet <strong>all </strong>of the following criteria <strong>over the previous 12 months </strong>to maintain a perfect compliance record in their payroll deductions and GST/HST accounts:</p>

<ul>
<li>The payroll deduction account <strong>must </strong>have:
<ul>
<li>no late remittances or late remitting penalties (LRP) </li>
<li>no failure to remit (FTR) penalties </li>
<li>no failure to deduct (FTD) penalties </li>
<li>no overdue T4-type information return(s) </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the employer has a GST/HST account, it <strong>must </strong>have:
<ul>
<li>no balance owing </li>
<li>no overdue returns </li>
<li>no credit balance with a refund hold </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Quarterly remitters - Small employers</h4>
<p>An existing employer is an employer whose payroll deduction account has been open for at least <strong>12 months </strong>(if the employer has multiple payroll deduction accounts, at least one must have been open for at least 12 months).</p>
<p>Existing employers are eligible to remit quarterly if they meet <strong>all </strong>of the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
<li>they have a payroll account that has been open for at least 12 months </li>
<li>the AMWA in the calendar year before the previous calendar year was less than <strong>$3,000</strong> </li>
<li>a perfect compliance record is maintained on all payroll and GST/HST program accounts over a 12-month period.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Existing employers who qualify to be quarterly remitters are notified in writing.</p>
<p>Existing employers who no longer qualify as quarterly remitters will be assigned a new remitter type for the following calendar year.</p>
<h5>Perfect compliance record</h5>
<p>Quarterly remitters <strong>must </strong>meet <strong>all </strong>of the following criteria <strong>over the previous 12 months </strong>to maintain a perfect compliance record in their payroll deductions and GST/HST accounts:</p>

<ul>
<li>The payroll deduction account <strong>must </strong>have:
<ul>
<li>no late remittances or late remitting penalties (LRP) </li>
<li>no failure to remit (FTR) penalties </li>
<li>no failure to deduct (FTD) penalties </li>
<li>no overdue T4-type information return(s) </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the employer has a GST/HST account, it <strong>must </strong>have:
<ul>
<li>no balance owing </li>
<li>no overdue returns </li>
<li>no credit balance with a refund hold </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Regular remitters</h4>
<p>Existing employers who meet <strong>both </strong>of the following conditions are regular remitters:</p>

<ul>
<li>the AMWA in the calendar year before the previous calendar year was less than <strong>$25,000</strong> </li>
<li>the CRA has not assigned another remitter type </li>
</ul>
<h4>Accelerated remitters - Threshold 1 ($25,000 - $99,999.99)</h4>
<p>Existing employers who meet <strong>both </strong>of the following conditions are Threshold 1 accelerated remitters:</p>

<ul>
<li>the AMWA in the calendar year before the previous calendar year was at least <strong>$25,000 </strong>but not more than <strong>$99,999.99</strong> </li>
<li>the CRA has not assigned another remitter type </li>
</ul>
<h4>Accelerated remitters - Threshold 2 ($100,000 or more)</h4>
<p>Existing employers who meet <strong>both </strong>of the following conditions are Threshold 2 accelerated remitters:</p>

<ul>
<li>the AMWA in the calendar year before the previous calendar year was at least <strong>$100,000</strong> </li>
<li>the CRA has not assigned another remitter type </li>
