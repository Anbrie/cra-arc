  <ul>
    <li>Send a generic email  to the individual to ensure they understand that email is not a secure method  of communication, and also to ensure you have the correct email address. </li>
    <li>To protect your  privacy, use a separate email account and block your number from being  displayed when communicating with taxpayers.
	<details>
	  <summary>Sample of generic email</summary> 
	  <p>Hello,</p>
	  <p>I would like to communicate with you via email  which is an unsecure method of communication. All efforts will be made to  ensure that your personal information is protected throughout our  correspondences. We would like to confirm that we will not be saving any  personal information and all emails will be deleted upon filing your tax return.  Please reply to this email to continue using email to correspond with me, a  CVITP volunteer, in order to complete your tax return(s).</p>
	  <p>Thank you,</p>
	  <p>(insert name of CVITP volunteer)</p>
	</details>	
	</li>
    <li>Once the individual  replies providing consent the email address used is correct, send the password  protected PDF of the TIS60 as an attachment by email. </li>
    <li>Provide the password  to the individual over the phone, via text message or in a separate email. Do  not include the password in the same email as the document(s).</li>
    <li>Once the individual  has accessed the TIS60 form PDF, advise them to: electronically sign Part D of  the form and email it back to you. </li>
    <li>If they are unable  to sign electronically they can also print the form, sign it, and then either  show you the signed form while video conferencing or email it back to you after  scanning or taking a picture of the signed form.</li>
    <li>Email should only be used for obtaining consent  to electronically file the TIS60 form. Avoid using email or social media  channels to prepare an individual&rsquo;s tax return. For more information on PDFs of  UFile CVITP forms and documents, refer to How to review and submit the tax return in the <a href="../navigating-through.html">UFile overview</a> section</li>

  <div id="option-2" class="hidden alert alert-info provisional">
  <h4>Provide a printed copy</h4>  
  <p><strong>Option 2: Provide a copy of the TIS60 with Part C completed  to the organization</strong></p>
  <ul><li>The organization can  arrange to have the individual sign Part D and can then notify you when the  form has been completed.</li>
    <li>The  individual would retain the signed copy for their records.</li>
  </ul>

<h4>Obtain verbal consent</h4>
<p><strong>Option 3: Obtain verbal consent from the individual</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Only if <strong>option 1 or 2  are not possible, could you instead</strong> obtain verbal authorization from the  individual, by reading the following script:
    <p>Before I file your tax return, please confirm the amounts I am about to  share with you are correct and complete, and that you have fully disclosed your  income from all sources. Also, please confirm that you authorize me to file  your tax return electronically</p>
    <p>Based on the information  you provided:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>your total income is $XXXX, </li>
        <li>your taxable income is $XXXX, </li>
        <li>your total non-refundable tax credits are $XXXX, and </li>
        <li>you have a balance owing/refund of $XXXX. </li>
      </ul>

    <p>Do you authorize me to  EFILE your return with the amounts I just read to you? </p>
 
	</li>
</ul>

</div>

<p>Once the individual signs the TIS60 or you have  obtained their verbal consent, EFILE the return. If the return cannot be  transmitted, print a paper copy of the return for the individual and ask them to  mail it to the CRA for processing. Refer  to <a href="../contacts-links.html">Contacts and links</a> to ensure that you provide  them with the correct mailing address for their applicable Tax Centre.</p>

  <p>Each person's return  must be transmitted individually, immediately  upon completion. For step-by-step instructions on how  to transmit the return using UFile CVITP, refer to <a href="../navigating-through/review.html">Finalizing and sending the return</a> under the CVITP tax software  overview.</p>

<p> There may be  circumstances when it may not be possible to transmit a return immediately upon  completion such as in clinic locations where internet isn&rsquo;t available. </p>
  <p> In instances where  you are unable to transmit a return immediately, ensure that you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Always</strong> encrypt returns using the tax software and save  the files on a USB flash drive <strong>only</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Never</strong> save a copy of the individual's return on the hard  drive of your computer </li>
    <li>delete the saved return no more than <strong>48 hours  after the transmission has been accepted</strong> by the CRA </li>
