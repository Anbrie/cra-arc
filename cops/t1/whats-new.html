        <h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Tax changes and improvements to services are noted on this page. Also noted are changes to income tax rules, including those that were announced but not yet law when the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/tax-packages-years/general-income-tax-benefit-package.html">Income tax package</a> was published in November 2021. If these changes become law as proposed or announced, they will be effective for 2021 or as of the dates given. New items are flagged with <strong>NEW!</strong> throughout the Federal Income Tax and Benefit Guide.</p>
<p>Several changes have been made to the Income tax package, such as making the Federal Income Tax and Benefit Guide easier to read and moving the text for some income, deductions, and credits to the Federal Worksheet and schedules.</p>
<p>You can also find more information about the lines of the Income Tax and Benefit Return by going to <span class="nowrap"><strong>canada.ca/line-xxxxx</strong></span>&nbsp;and replacing &quot;<strong>xxxxx</strong>” with any 5-digit line number from the return. For example, go to <strong>canada.ca/line-10100</strong>&nbsp;for information about <span class="nowrap"><a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/personal-income/line-10100-employment-income.html">line 10100</a></span>.

        <h2>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA’</abbr>s services</h2>
<h3>Electronic notices of assessment or reassessment for electronic filers</h3>
<p>Sometime in 2022, the CRA will start the process of switching to electronic notices of assessment or reassessment when you file your income tax and benefit return. For more information, see <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/notice-assessment-understand.html">Notice of assessment</a>.</p>

        <h2>COVID-19 benefits and your taxes</h2>
<h3>Amounts received related to <span class="nowrap">COVID-19</span></h3>
<p>If you received federal, provincial, or territorial government <span class="nowrap">COVID-19</span> benefit payments, such as the Canada Recovery Benefit (CRB), Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit (CRSB), or Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit (CRCB), you will receive a <span class="nowrap">T4A slip</span> with instructions on how to report these amounts on your return. These slips are also available in <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-individuals/account-individuals.html"><span class="nowrap">My Account</span> for individuals</a>.</p>
<p>If you are self-employed and received federal, provincial, or territorial government <span class="nowrap">COVID-19</span> assistance for your business, such as the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS), Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy (CERS), Canada Recovery Hiring Program (CRHP) or Fish Harvester Benefit and Grant Program (FHBGP), you have to include these amounts in your business income or reduce your expenses by the amounts you received. If you received a government loan, the loan is not taxable but you have to include in your business income any portion of the loan that is forgivable.</p>
<p>If you received the CRB, you may have to repay all or part of the amount received if your net income after certain adjustments is <strong>more than $38,000</strong>. The repayment is calculated using the chart for <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/line-23500-canada-recovery-benefit-repayment.html"><span class="nowrap">line 23500</span></a> of the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/tax-packages-years/general-income-tax-benefit-package/5000-d1.html">Federal Worksheet</a>.</p>
<h4>If your income was tax exempt</h4>
<p>If your CRB, CRCB, or CRSB income is eligible for tax exemption under <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/indigenous-peoples/information-indians.html"><span class="nowrap">section 87</span> of the Indian Act</a>, complete <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t90.html"><span class="nowrap">Form T90</span>, Income Exempt from Tax under the Indian Act</a>, and file your <span class="nowrap">2021 Income</span> Tax and Benefit Return or simplified return to claim the tax withheld on your CRB, CRCB, and CRSB payments. For more information, see <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/indigenous-peoples.html">Taxes and benefits for Indigenous peoples</a>.</p>
<h3>Federal <span class="nowrap">COVID-19</span> benefits repayment</h3>
<p>If you repaid federal <span class="nowrap">COVID-19</span> benefits (CERB, CESB, CRB, CRCB, or CRSB) in 2021 that you received in 2020, the amount repaid will be reported in <strong><span class="nowrap">box 201</span></strong> of your <span class="nowrap">T4A slip</span> or on your <span class="nowrap">T4E slip</span> along with other employment insurance (EI) amounts repaid. You can choose to claim a deduction on your return for the repayment in the year that the benefit was received or in the year that the benefit was repaid. You may also choose to split the deduction between these two returns as long as the total deduction is not more than the amount repaid. For more information, see <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/deductions-credits-expenses/line-23210-federal-covid-19-benefits-repayment.html"><span class="nowrap">line 23210</span></a> or <a href="/en/services/taxes/income-tax/personal-income-tax/covid19-taxes.html"><span class="nowrap">COVID-19</span> benefits and your taxes</a>.</p>

        <h2>Individuals and families</h2>
<h3>Canada workers benefit</h3>
<p>The Canada workers benefit (CWB) rates and income thresholds have changed for 2021. A new “secondary earner exemption” has also been introduced.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/tax-packages-years/general-income-tax-benefit-package.html"><span class="nowrap">Schedule 6</span>, Canada Workers Benefit</a>, for your province or territory.</p>
<h3>Zero-emission vehicles</h3>
<p>The definition of zero-emission vehicle has changed for vehicles acquired <strong>after <span class="nowrap">March 1, 2020</span></strong>. A vehicle may still qualify as a zero-emission vehicle if the vehicle was subject to a prior capital cost allowance (CCA) or terminal loss claim provided that the vehicle was not acquired by the taxpayer on a tax-deferred “rollover” basis or previously owned or acquired by the taxpayer or a non-arm’s length person or partnership.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/t4002.html"><span class="nowrap">Guide T4002</span>, Self-employed Business, Professional, Commission, Farming, and Fishing Income</a>, if you are self-employed, or <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/t4044.html"><span class="nowrap">Guide T4044</span>, Employment Expenses</a>, if you are claiming employment expenses.</p>
