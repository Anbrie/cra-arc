        <p>There are several ways to file or send your tax return. However, if you are a<span class="nowrap"> non-resident</span>, the only method currently available to file is by mail.</p>

        <h2>By Internet</h2>
<h3>NETFILE</h3>
<p>NETFILE is a secure service that allows you to file your income tax and benefit return electronically using <a href="https://canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-individuals/netfile-overview/certified-software-netfile-program.html">tax preparation software</a> or a web tax application. For a list of available software and applications, including <strong>free ones,</strong> go to&nbsp;<a href="https://canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-individuals/netfile-overview.html">NETFILE</a>.</p>

            <div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <p>Before filing online, your information, including your address, must be up to date. If you have registered for the full version of <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>'s <a href="https://canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-individuals/account-individuals.html"><span class="nowrap">My Account</span></a> or <a href="https://canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/cra-mobile-apps.html"><span class="nowrap">MyCRA</span></a> service, you can change your address and update your direct deposit information in participating NETFILE certified tax preparation software. If not, you must tell the CRA your new address <a href="https://canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information/telephone-numbers.html">by phone</a>.</p>
<p>For the <span class="nowrap">2021 tax year</span>, prior to filing your tax return electronically with NETFILE, you will be asked to enter an <strong>Access code</strong> after your name, date of birth, and social insurance number. Your <span class="nowrap">eight-character</span> Access code is made up of numbers and letters and is located on the <strong>right</strong> side of your Notice of Assessment for a previous tax year. While this Access code is not mandatory, if you do not enter your Access code, you will not be able to use any information from your <span class="nowrap">2021 tax return</span> when confirming your identity with the Canada Revenue Agency. You will have to rely on other information for authentication purposes. This code does not apply to you if you are filing your tax return for the <span class="nowrap">first time</span>.</p>

<p>EFILE is a secure service that lets authorized service providers, including a <a href="https://canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-individuals/efile-individuals/discounter-information-individuals.html">discounter</a>, complete and file your return electronically.

        <h3><span class="nowrap">Auto-fill </span>my return</h3>
<p><span class="nowrap">Auto-fill</span> my return is a&nbsp;secure <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA </abbr>service that lets you or your authorized service provider automatically fill in certain parts of your current year return. The CRA will have most tax information from most tax slips, such as T4s,&nbsp;as well as registered retirement savings plan information, and carry forward amounts.</p>
<p>To <span class="nowrap">auto-fill</span> your return, you&nbsp;must be registered with <a href="https://canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-individuals/account-individuals.html"><span class="nowrap">My Account</span></a> and be using a certified software product that offers this option. For more information, go to <a href="https://canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/about-auto-fill-return.html"><span class="nowrap">Auto-fill </span>my return</a>.</p>

        <h2>By mail</h2>
<p>Whether you are a resident or a <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span>, you can mail your return to your <a href="https://canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information/where-mail-your-paper-t1-return.html">tax centre</a>.</p>
<p>Online tax returns are processed without delays, but paper returns take longer to process, and could take even longer because of <span class="nowrap">COVID-19</span>. Filing online is the fastest and easiest way to do your taxes, and if you’re signed up for direct deposit, you can get your refund in as little as <span class="nowrap">eight business</span> days.</p>
<p>If you prepare your&nbsp;return or other people’s returns, mail or deliver each person’s return in a separate envelope. However, if you file returns for more than one year for the same person, put them all in one envelope.</p>
