If you have to prepare more than one T4&nbsp;slip for the employee because the employee worked for you in more than one province or territory of employment, report the PA proportionately on each T4&nbsp;slip. If you cannot apportion the PA, report it on one slip.</p>
                  <p>If an employee participates in one or more RPPs or DPSPs, you have to calculate their PA using the <strong>total</strong> amount of all pension credits accumulated by the employee under all these plans for the year.</p>
                  <p>If an employee is on a leave of absence and is still accruing pensionable service or credits under the plan, you must report the PA on a T4&nbsp;slip. This is true even if the employee has no employment income in the tax year. Administrators of multi-employee plans (MEPs) should report the PA for the employee on leave on a <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t4a.html">T4A&nbsp;slip</a>.</p>
                  <p>Leave box&nbsp;52 blank if the employee participated in your RPP or DPSP and <strong>one</strong> of the following applies:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>the calculated PA is a negative amount or zero</li>
                     <li>the employee died during the year</li>
                     <li>the employee, even if they are still a member of the plan, no longer accrues new pension credits in the year (for example, the employee has accrued the maximum number of years of service in respect of the plan)</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h3>Special rules concerning the PA</h3>
                  <p>Special calculation rules apply, in some circumstances, to employees who:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>left your employment during the year</li>
                     <li>are on, or return from, a leave of absence</li>
