		<h2>Getting benefits and credits</h2>
		<p>Indigenous peoples have access to the same benefits and credits as other Canadians. If you don't file a tax return, you won't be able to get some of those benefits and credits.</p>
		<h3>File a tax return every year</h3>
		<p>To continue getting your benefit and credit payments, you need to do your taxes on time <strong>every year</strong>, even if your income is tax exempt or you had no income at all. If you have a spouse or common-law partner, they also need to do their taxes every year so that the CRA can calculate your payments.</p>
		<h3>You must file a tax and benefit return to get any of the following:</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>Goods and services tax/Harmonized sales tax credit (GST/HST)</li>
		<li>Canada child benefit (CCB)</li>
		<li>Child disability benefit</li>
		<li>Disability tax credit</li>
		<li>Northern residents deduction</li>
		<li>Canada workers benefit</li>
		<li>Canada training credit</li>
		<li>Climate action incentive</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Get help doing your tax return</h2>

		<li>you did not make any repayments of universal child care benefit payments in 2020</li>

		<h2>Documents to confirm your details</h2>
		<p>Your <strong>benefits may stop</strong> if you don't reply and provide all the information requested. If you do not have the documents or need some extra time to gather them, contact the CRA. Be sure to consider:</p>

				<p>The CERB is generally a taxable benefit. A T4A tax slip will be made available for the 2020 tax year in CRA My Account under Tax Information Slips (T4 and more). If you received the CERB from Service Canada, you will receive a T4E tax slip at tax time or you may also get your T4E information from My Service Canada Account.</p>
		<p>You will need to report any taxable CERB payments you receive on your 2020 income tax return. If you have a balance owing for 2020, your payment will be due on or before April 30, 2021.</p>
		<p>The CERB received by a self-employed person will be treated in the same way as their total self-employment income that entitled them to the CERB. This total income is the person’s total self-employment income for 2019 (reference period A) or the 12-month period prior to the date of their application (reference period B). Therefore, if the person’s total self-employment income that entitled them to the CERB in either reference period A or reference period B is exempt from income tax under section 87 of the Indian Act, their CERB will also be exempt.</p>
		<p>If the person’s total self-employment income that entitled them to the CERB is partially exempt from tax in both reference periods, their CERB will also be partially exempt. The CERB will be treated as exempt in the same proportion as the total self-employment income of the reference period that is more advantageous to the person.</p>
		<p>If the person’s total self-employment income that entitled them to the CERB in one reference period is partially exempt and the total self-employment income in the other reference period is taxable, the person’s CERB will be treated as exempt in the same proportion as the total self-employment income of the reference period that was partially exempt.</p>
		<p>If the person’s total self-employment income that entitled them to the CERB is taxable in both reference periods, their CERB will also be taxable.</p>

		<p>No. The exempt CRB should not be included in your income pursuant to paragraph 81(1)(a) of the Act.

		<div id="benefits-q1">
		<p>If your income is eligible for tax exemption under section 87 of the Indian Act, some of the recovery benefit payments you received may be tax exempt. The recovery benefits you received will be taxed or tax exempt in the same way as the total income earned during the timeframe that entitled you to the benefit (2019 or the 12 months before the date you applied). </p>
		
		<p>If your total income for the timeframe that entitled you to the recovery benefits was:</p>
		<ul>
		<li><strong>tax exempt in both</strong> 2019 and the 12 months before you applied, your recovery benefits are tax exempt</li>
		<li><strong>taxable</strong> both in 2019 and in the 12 months before you applied, your recovery benefits are taxable</li>
		<li><strong>tax exempt in only one timeframe</strong>, your recovery benefits received for any eligibility period in 2020 are tax exempt</li>
		<li><strong>partially tax exempt in both timeframes</strong>, your recovery benefits are partially exempt and will be treated as exempt in the same proportion as the timeframe that is more advantageous to you</li>
		<li><strong>partially tax exempt in one timeframe, but taxable in the other</strong>, your recovery benefits will be treated as exempt in the same proportion as the timeframe that is partially exempt</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Additionally, if you have both taxable and tax exempt income, your recovery benefits may be exempt in the proportion of the exempt income lost instead of the total income lost, if this is more advantageous to you. This applies if, due to COVID-19, you had a 50% reduction in your average weekly employment income or net self-employment income that includes a reduction of exempt income.</p>

		<div id="benefits-q2">
		<p>The recovery benefits you receive will be treated in the same way as the total income that entitled you to these benefits.</p>
		<p>The recovery benefits are available to workers who earned a minimum total income of $5,000 from one or more of the following sources; employment income, self-employment income and/or provincial or federal benefits related to maternity or paternity leave. Total income includes income exempt under section 87 of the Indian Act.</p>
		<p>If the recovery benefits are in respect of a two-week period beginning in 2021, this total income is your total income for either 2019, 2020, or in the 12-month period preceding the day on which you made your application (straddle period).</p>
		<p>Therefore, if the total income that entitled you to the benefits in 2019, 2020 or the straddle period is exempt from income tax under section 87 of the Indian Act, your recovery benefits will also be exempt. If the total income that entitled you to the Canada recovery benefits is partially exempt from tax in all the periods, your Canada recovery benefits will also be partially exempt.</p>
		<p>The recovery benefits will be treated as exempt in the same proportion as the total income of the period that is more advantageous to you. If your total income that entitled you to the recovery benefits in two periods is partially exempt and the total income in the other period is taxable, your recovery benefits will be treated as exempt in the same proportion as the total income of the period that was partially exempt that is more advantageous to you.</p>
		<p>If your total income that entitled you to the recovery benefits in one period is partially exempt and the total income in the other periods is taxable, your recovery benefits will be treated as exempt in the same proportion as the total income of the period that was partially exempt.</p>
		<p>If your total income that entitled you to the recovery benefits is taxable in all periods, your recovery benefits will also be taxable.</p>
		<p>In addition, if you have a combination of taxable and exempt income and you had a reduction of at least 50% in your average weekly employment income or self-employment income that includes a reduction of exempt income, for reasons related to COVID-19, the recovery benefits you received may be exempt in the proportion of the exempt income lost over the total income lost, if this proportion is more advantageous to you.</p>

		<p>No. An individual whose entire income in 2020 or 2021 is exempt from tax under section 87 of the Indian Act will not be subject to the CRB repayment in that year even if their income is greater than $38,000 for that year.</p>
		<p>An individual’s “income” as defined in subsection 8(3) of the Canada Recovery Benefits Act (the CRBA) is determined under part I of the Income Tax Act. Paragraph 81(1)(a) of the Act excludes income exempt under section 87 of the Indian Act when computing the income of a taxpayer for a taxation year under Part I of the Act.</p>
		<p>The CRBA does not have a specific provision to include the section 87 exempt income for the purpose of calculating the income for repayment in subsection 8(2) of the CRBA. Pursuant to subsection 8(3) of the CRBA, an individual’s income exempt under section 87 of the Indian Act is not included in the calculation of income, and therefore, the individual is not subject to the CRB repayment specified in subsection 8(2) of the CRBA.</p>

		<div id="benefits-q4">
		<p>It depends on the facts of a particular situation. Pursuant to subsection 8(2) of the CRBA, an individual is required to repay an amount equal to 50 cents for every dollar of income earned in that year above $38,000 of income, up to the total amount of the CRB received by them in that year.</p>
		<p>Accordingly, if the individual has other income that is not exempt from tax that exceeds the stated amount of $38,000, they will be subject to the repayment of the CRB regardless of whether or not they have exempt income. On the other hand, if the individual’s other income that is not exempt from tax is less than or equal to $38,000 for 2020 or 2021, the individual will not be subject to the repayment in that year.</p>

				<summary>Will the CESB be exempt from tax under section 87 of the Indian Act?</summary>
				<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
			
		
			
				<p>No. The CESB is not considered to be situated on a reserve as there are insufficient factors connecting this income to a reserve. It is available to all Canadians who qualify and are paid from general government funds. This benefit is not paid by First Nations or with money specifically set aside for First Nation individuals.</p>
		<p>Furthermore, similar to a social assistance payment or an old age security payment, the CESB is available to all eligible individuals regardless of whether they are First Nation individuals or whether they earned income in 2019 or in the 12-month period prior to the date of their application.</p>
		<p>The fact that the recipient is a First Nation individual residing on a reserve is not sufficient to result in the benefit being situated on a reserve, and therefore, it is not exempt from tax under section 87 of the Indian Act.</p>

		<summary>Will the CESB be treated like an old age security (OAS) payment?</summary>
		<p>The OAS payment is a monthly payment available to seniors aged 65 and older who meet the Canadian citizenship and residency requirements. Old age security income has never been considered to be personal property situated on a reserve because it does not have any reserve connection and therefore, it remains taxable.</p>
		<p>There are differences between the eligibility requirements of the CESB and the OAS. Unlike the OAS, which only has an age and Canadian citizenship and residency requirements, the CESB has other eligibility requirements which may be considered as connecting factors. However, it is our view that these factors are not significant enough to connect the CESB to a reserve and therefore, the CESB will be taxable.</p>

				<p>No. Form T90, Income exempt from tax under the Indian Act, is mainly used to calculate a First Nation individual's total exempt working income (line 4) and net exempt income (line 17) for purposes of the Canada workers benefit. Line 7 of Form T90 E(20) refers to the federal, provincial, or territorial government COVID-19 payments received in the year.</p>
		<p>The instruction for what amounts to be entered on line 7 of Form T90 E(20) further clarifies that only the exempt portion of the COVID-19 payments received from the federal, provincial, or territorial government be entered on line 7.</p>
		<p>The CESB is not exempt from tax under section 87 of the Indian Act and therefore, should not be included on line 7 of Form T90.</p>
