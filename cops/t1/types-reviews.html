        <p>Our review programs include the:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#psment">Pre-assessment Review Program</a></li>
<li><a href="#prvw">Processing Review Program</a></li>
<li><a href="#rvp">Request Verification Program</a></li>
<li><a href="#rep">Refund Examination Program</a></li>
<li><a href="#sep">Supplementary Examination Program</a></li>
<li><a href="#mtch">Matching Program</a></li>
<li><a href="#ssment">Special Assessments Program</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Under these programs, we review various income amounts, federal and provincial/territorial deductions, and credits on income tax and benefit returns to make sure that amounts are reported correctly and that they are properly supported. During our reviews, we may ask for documents to support any claims made.</p>

    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h2 id="psment">Pre-assessment Review Program</h2>
<p>The reviews conducted during this program take place before a notice of assessment is issued.</p>

    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h2 id="prvw">Processing Review Program</h2>
<p>Although similar to the pre-assessment review program, the reviews conducted during this program take place after the notice of assessment has been issued.</p>

    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h2 id="rvp">Request Verification Program</h2>
<p>The reviews conducted during this program take place before a notice of reassessment is issued. In this program, we review the request to change your return to make sure that the change requested is allowable and properly supported.</p>

    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h2 id="rep">Refund Examination Program</h2>
<p>The reviews conducted during this program can take place before or after a notice of assessment has been issued.</p>
<p>Reviews are carried out to ensure the proper refund is issued under the Income Tax Act.</p>

    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h2 id="sep">Supplementary Examination Program</h2>
<p>The reviews conducted by this program concern income/loss amounts as well as deductions that require a more detailed examination. They can take place before or after a notice of (re)assessment has been issued.</p>

    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h2 id="mtch">Matching Program</h2>
<p>The reviews conducted during this program also take place after the notice of assessment has been issued. In this program, information on your return is compared to information provided by third-party sources, such as employers or financial institutions.</p>

    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h2 id="ssment">Special Assessments Program</h2>
<p>The reviews conducted during this program can take place before or after a notice of assessment has been issued.</p>
<p>The special assessments program conducts a more in-depth review of income tax and benefit returns to identify and gather information on trends and situations in areas of non-compliance that may represent a risk to the self-assessment system.</p>
<p>All requests for information in this program are sent directly to the taxpayer. This includes taxpayers who have authorized someone to act on their behalf, such as a tax preparer.</p>
