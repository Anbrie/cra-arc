<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> agrees with this recommendation in part.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> does not believe that the inclusion of the Taxpayer Bill of Rights (<abbr title="Taxpayer Bill of Rights">TBR</abbr>) in its policy framework as a fundamental component of the corporate policy suite would have the intended outcome since corporate policy is distinct from program policy (program policy consists of tax and benefits programs).</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> does however agree that assessing the existing uses of, and references to, the <abbr title="Taxpayer Bill of Rights">TBR</abbr> on an ongoing basis is important to ensure that it is upheld. As the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> continues to pursue its transformation, it will examine how best to embed the <abbr title="Taxpayer Bill of Rights">TBR</abbr> into its culture change.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> also agrees that when it creates or updates materials, and designs or redesigns its programs and services, that it is important to consider the relationship to, and any potential impact on the <abbr title="Taxpayer Bill of Rights">TBR</abbr>. As a result, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> will explore the feasibility of developing a methodology or protocol to assess its products through a <abbr title="Taxpayer Bill of Rights">TBR</abbr> lens.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>’s Code of Integrity and Professional Conduct (Code) does not establish rules for employees to follow, but rather reflects rules, legislation, and specific expectations that have been established elsewhere in the Agency.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> is nearing the completion of a scheduled 5 year comprehensive review of the Code.

        <h3><abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>’s response</h3>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> agrees with this recommendation in part.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> is unable to implement this recommendation to the extent suggested due to the scope of the <abbr title="Taxpayer Bill of Rights">TBR</abbr>.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Taxpayer Bill of Rights">TBR</abbr> describes the treatment a taxpayer is entitled to when they deal with the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>. The Community Volunteer Income Tax Program (<abbr title="Community Volunteer Income Tax Program">CVITP</abbr>) is a collaboration between the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> and community organizations. Community organizations host tax preparation clinics across Canada and arrange for volunteers to prepare income tax and benefit returns for eligible individuals. When a taxpayer is dealing with a <abbr title="Community Volunteer Income Tax Program">CVITP</abbr> clinic, they are not dealing directly with the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>. While the <abbr title="Community Volunteer Income Tax Program">CVITP</abbr> volunteers are not responsible for upholding the <abbr title="Taxpayer Bill of Rights">TBR</abbr>, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> does agree that it would be beneficial for them to be aware of it.</p>
<p>Therefore, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> agrees to conduct a review of the training package for <abbr title="Community Volunteer Income Tax Program">CVITP</abbr> volunteers to see where it would be feasible to include mention of the <abbr title="Taxpayer Bill of Rights">TBR</abbr>.</p>

        <h3><abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>’s response</h3>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> agrees with this recommendation in part.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> currently has an external webpage committed to information related to the <abbr title="Taxpayer Bill of Rights">TBR</abbr>. This page is in the process of being updated to include the information noted in this recommendation. As a result, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> has determined that it would not be efficient to create a separate internal webpage containing the same information. Any hyperlinks added to internal products and webpages will point to the external <abbr title="Taxpayer Bill of Rights">TBR</abbr> webpage.</p>
<p>As noted in the Ombudsman report, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> already makes linkages to the <abbr title="Taxpayer Bill of Rights">TBR</abbr> in several of its corporate plans and reports, and will continue to do so. In addition, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> commits to the following actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>ensuring that as internal products and webpages are going through routine updates that they are reviewed for opportunities to link to and promote the <abbr title="Taxpayer Bill of Rights">TBR</abbr>;</li>
<li>ensuring that the process for developing new internal products and webpages includes identifying opportunities to incorporate information and linkages to the <abbr title="Taxpayer Bill of Rights">TBR</abbr>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> will conduct a review of its existing internal products and webpages, where relevant, to identify opportunities to incorporate linkages to and promotion of the <abbr title="Taxpayer Bill of Rights">TBR</abbr>.</p>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h3><abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>’s response</h3>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> agrees with this recommendation in part.</p>
<p>In addition to the mandatory performance expectations set out by the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> for its Executives (<abbr title="Executives">EXs</abbr>) that include the mandatory commitments and corporate priorities on which they are expected to deliver, <abbr title="Executives">EXs</abbr> have to list their key priorities relating to the programs, projects or services for which they are responsible along with associated performance measures that are applicable.</p>
<p>Since not all executives play a direct role in upholding the <abbr title="Taxpayer Bill of Rights">TBR</abbr> in their area of responsibility, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> does not believe that it would be appropriate to create a mandatory performance expectation related to this requirement. However, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> has decided to add the <abbr title="Taxpayer Bill of Rights">TBR</abbr> to the list of documents that <abbr title="Executives">EXs</abbr> are asked to reference as they set out their deliverables and performance measures associated with key government priorities and documents relating to their area of responsibility.</p>

        <h3><abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>’s response</h3>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> agrees with this recommendation in principle.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> agrees that promoting the <abbr title="Taxpayer Bill of Rights">TBR</abbr> and making it a more prominent fixture in its facilities would be an effective means of raising the awareness of its employees.</p>
<p>In achieving this goal and based on its experiences, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> believes that the most impactful placement for this type of information is not necessarily in public facing areas as recommended or in areas where there is a lot of transitory movement, such as entry ways, elevators, lobbies, etc. It has been noted that when information is placed in these types of areas, individuals will usually pass by without paying much attention to what is posted.</p>
<p>In addition, it is important to keep in mind that the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> currently occupies 102 buildings nationally in one capacity or another. 38% of the buildings are Crown owned while 62% are leased (either space within the building or the entire building). There is an extensive process to request permission from landlords to post information in public facing areas, without a guarantee that permission will be granted. Based on past experiences and its commitment to sustainable development, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> will explore best practices that will allow it to make the best use of&nbsp; available resources to pursue this option.</p>
<p>In addition, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> believes that a digital solution would be the most effective and efficient method of promoting the <abbr title="Taxpayer Bill of Rights">TBR</abbr>. The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> agrees to conduct an analysis of the digital options available for this purpose.</p>
<p>In the interim, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> will send an email to all of its employees which will include a copy of the <abbr title="Taxpayer Bill of Rights">TBR</abbr> poster and a link to the <abbr title="Taxpayer Bill of Rights">TBR</abbr> webpage.</p>
<p>This will complement the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>’s existing initiatives to promote the <abbr title="Taxpayer Bill of Rights">TBR</abbr> such as the annual communication on the <abbr title="Taxpayer Bill of Rights">TBR</abbr> sent by the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>’s Commissioner&nbsp; and the posting of the <abbr title="Taxpayer Bill of Rights">TBR</abbr> banner to the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>’s login screen for employees for a week’s rotation.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> agrees with this recommendation in part.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> has made a commitment to &quot;Making information more helpful and easier to understand&quot; as part of its People First campaign. This commitment includes the following statement:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">&quot;The Taxpayer Bill of Rights states that every Canadian has the right to complete, accurate, clear, and timely information that explains the laws and policies that apply to their unique situation.&quot;</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> is already working to include its People First messaging in all of its external communications products, where appropriate.</p>
<p>In addition, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> will conduct a review of its external webpages and public facing products to determine if there are relevant opportunities to promote the <abbr title="Taxpayer Bill of Rights">TBR</abbr>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> agrees with this recommendation in principle.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> agrees that reporting on how its service improvements align with the <abbr title="Taxpayer Bill of Rights">TBR</abbr> would be a positive step in the right direction, and as it pursues its Agency transformation, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> will explore if it is feasible to communicate on how its progress aligns with taxpayer rights, where applicable, particularly in its corporate documents.</p>
<p>Since the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> follows up on the commitments it makes in its action plans on a yearly basis, it will examine the possibility of using this process as a means of tracking its progress with respect to its commitments related to the <abbr title="Taxpayer Bill of Rights">TBR</abbr>.</p>
