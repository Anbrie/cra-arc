<h1 property="name" id="wb-cont">Taxes and benefits for Indigenous peoples</h1>
<section>

<p>As an Indigenous person, there may be some forms or processes specific to you. But in general, tax obligations are the same as any other resident in Canada.</p>
<p>We acknowledge that people may not want to be referred to using outdated terms, however, for the purposes of the tax exemption under section 87 of the <i>Indian Act</i>, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) uses the term "Indian" because it has a
legal meaning in the <i>Indian Act</i>.</p>

<li><a href="#getting">Getting benefits and credits</a></li>
<li><a href="#covid">If you received COVID-related benefits</a></li>
<li><a href="#taxes">Doing your taxes</a></li>
<li><a href="#validation">If you received a validation letter</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="getting">Getting benefits and credits</h2>
		<p>There are some benefits that are only available if you file a tax return. So it’s worth doing even if you normally don’t have to</p>
		<p>For example, the following benefits are available only once having filed:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>GST/HST credit</li>
				<li>Canada Child Benefit (CCB)</li>
				<li>Disability Tax Credit</li>
				<li>Northern Residents Deduction</li>
				<li>Canada Workers Benefit</li>
			</ul>
		<p>For information on benefits and credits for Indigenous peoples please see below:</p>
		<p><a href="#">Benefits and credits: Information for Indigenous peoples</a></p>
	<p><b>Simplified Tax Returns</b></p>
	<p>You may be eligible to use simplified returns called the <b>T1S-D, Credit and Benefit Return</b>, or the <b>Let Us Help You Get Your Benefits, Credit and Benefit Short Return</b> if you are registered under the <i>Indian Act</i>.
	These returns are not available to print from the CRA website. Your band council may already have some, or could order them for you. You can also ask a CRA outreach officer during a virtual outreach visit.</p>
	<p>You can use the <b>T1S-D, Credit and Benefit Return</b> only if <b>all</b> of the following apply:</p>
			<ul type="disc">
				<li>you lived in Newfoundland and Labrador, Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, or Alberta on December 31 of the tax year</li>
				<li>all your income is tax exempt (except for retroactive universal child care benefit payments, old age security pension payments, social assistance payments, and net federal supplements)</li>
				<li>no tax was deducted from any of your income (except Canada Emergency Response Benefits)</li>
				<li>you did not receive any working income tax benefits advance payments in the tax year</li>
			</ul>
	<p>You can use the <b>Let Us Help You Get Your Benefits, Credit and Benefit Short Return</b> if you meet the eligibility criteria listed on the form and <b>all</b> the following apply:</p>
			<ul type="disc">
				<li>you were a resident of Canada throughout the year</li>
				<li>your taxable income is less than the basic personal amount for the province or territory that you lived on December 31 of the tax year</li>
				<li>you are not claiming the eligible educator school supply tax credit</li>
				<li>you are not filing this return for a deceased person</li>
		
	<h3>How personal circumstances affect access to benefits</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>If you’re married (common-law included), only one partner can access certain credits</li>
				<li>Canada Child Benefit also… other reasons</li>
			</ul>	
<h2 id="covid">If you received COVID-related benefits</h2>
		<p>If you received COVID benefits, you may be able to claim taxes back, or you may owe additional taxes.</p>
	<h3>If you received the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB)</h3>
		<p><b> Will the CERB still be taxable if it's received by someone with status living on reserve?</b>If your regular income is tax-exempt and you received CERB, you don’t have to pay taxes on the CERB</p>
			<p>The CERB you receive will be treated in the same way as your total income that entitled you to the CERB. This total income is your total income for 2019 (period 1) or the 12-month period prior to the date of your application (period 2).</p>
			<p>Therefore, if your total income that entitled you to the CERB in either period 1 or period 2 is exempt from income tax under section 87 of the Indian Act, your CERB will also be exempt. 
If your total income that entitled you to the CERB is partially exempt from tax in both periods, your CERB will also be partially exempt. The CERB will be treated as exempt in the same proportion as the total income of the period that is more advantageous to you. 
If your total income that entitled you to the CERB in one period is partially exempt and the total income in the other period is taxable, your CERB will be treated as exempt in the same proportion as the total income of the period that was partially exempt. 
If your total income that entitled you to the CERB is taxable in both periods, your CERB will also be taxable.</p>
				<p><b>There are a number of possible scenarios:</b></p>
				<p><b>i. A person worked on reserve and earned tax-exempt employment income of $24,000 ($2,000 per month) in 2019 and still works on reserve and earned tax-exempt employment income of $3,000 in the first three months in 2020. 
ii. A person worked on reserve and earned tax-exempt employment income of $24,000 ($2,000 per month) in 2019 but is not working on reserve in 2020 and earned taxable employment income of $6,000 in the first three months in 2020. 
iii. A person worked off reserve and earned tax-exempt employment income according to guideline 2 of the Indian Act Exemption for Employment Income Guidelines of $24,000 ($2,000 per month) in 2019 but in 2020 changed employment and earned taxable employment income off reserve of $6,000 in the first three months in 2020. 
iv. A person did not work on reserve and earned taxable employment income of $24,000 ($2,000 per month) in 2019, but is working on reserve in 2020 and earned tax-exempt employment income of $6,000 in the first three months in 2020. The person applied for the CERB on April 6, 2020. 
v. A person did not work on reserve and earned taxable employment income of $24,000 in 2019 and is not working on reserve in 2020 and earned taxable income of $6,000 in the first three months in 2020. 
				In each scenario, will the CERB be taxable or not?</b></p>
				<p>The CERB you receive will be treated in the same way as your total income that entitled you to the CERB. 
i. In scenario 1, since your total income that entitled you to the CERB is exempt from income tax, your CERB will also be exempt. 
ii. In scenario 2, since your total income in 2019 that entitled you to the CERB is exempt from tax, your CERB will also be exempt. The fact that you had taxable income in 2020 will not make your CERB taxable or partially taxable. Your CERB will be treated in the way that is more advantageous to you. 
iii. In scenario 3, since your total income in 2019 that entitled you to the CERB is exempt from tax, your CERB will also be exempt. The fact that you had taxable income in 2020 will not make your CERB taxable or partially taxable. Your CERB will be treated in the way that is more advantageous to you. 
iv. In scenario 4, since your total income in the 12-month period prior to the date of your application that entitled you to the CERB is partially (25%) exempt from tax, your CERB will also be partially exempt from tax and will be prorated in the proportion in which your income was exempt. Even though your total income in 2019 was taxable your CERB will be treated in the way that is more advantageous to you. 
v. In scenario 5, since of your total income that entitled you to the CERB is taxable, your CERB will also be taxable.</p>

	<h3>If you received one of the recovery benefits (CRB, CRSB, CRCB)</h3>
		<p><b>How do I collect the 10% withheld if my income is tax-exempt?</b></p>
		<p>If you received one of the Canada Recovery Benefits 10% of the tax was withheld at source, including those individuals with income that may be exempt from tax. If some or all of your income is exempt from tax under section 87 of the <i>Indian Act</i> and you are registered, or entitled to
		be registered as an Indian under that Act, you may be able to get part or all of the tax back for payments received in 2020 or 2021 by filing a tax return for that year. This may include filling out Form T90, Income exempt under the <i>Indian Act</i>, as part of the return or you may be eligible for a simple return (see the Getting Benefits and Credits section on this page)</p>
		<p><b>If the CRB received by an individual is exempt from tax under section 87 of the <i>Indian Act</i>, should it be included in the individual's income
		(determined under Part I of the <i>Income Tax Act</i>?</b></p>
		<p>No. The exempt CRB should not be included in the individual's income, the exempt income of an Indian under the <i>Indian Act</i> is not included in 
		computing the income of a taxpayer. However, if the CRB received by an individual is not exempt from tax under section 87 of the <i>Indian Act</i>, it 
		will be included in the individual's income.</p>
		<p><b>If an individual was in receipt of the CRB in 2020 or 2021 and their entire income for 2020 or 2021 is exempt from tax under section 87 of the <i>Indian Act</i>, will the individual be subject to the repayment in that year?</b></p>
		<p>No. An individual whose entire income in 2020 or 2021 is exempt from tax under section 87 of the <i>Indian Act</i> will not be subject to the CRB payment in that year even if their income is greater than $38,000 for that year.</p>
		<p><b>If an individual was in receipt of the CRB in 2020 or 2021 and has both exempt income and other income that is not exempt from tax in that year, will the individual be subject to the repayment in that year?</b></p>
		<p>It depends on the facts of the particular situation. An individual is required to repay an amount equal to 50 cents for every dollar of income earned in that year about $38,000 of income, up to the total amount of the CRB received by them in that year. Accordingly, if the individual has other income that is not exempt from tax that exceeds the stated amount of $38,000, 
		they will be subject to the repayment of the CRB regardless of whether or not they have exempt income. On the other hand, if the individual's other income that is not exempt from tax is less than or equal to $38,000 for 2020 or 2021, the individual will not be subject to the repayment in that year.</p>
	<p>If you earned more than $38,000 (other conditions) you will have to pay (something) back [use the Q and As that are being developed to answer this]</p>
		<p>If your income is tax-exempt, you probably don’t have to pay it back.</p>

<h2 id="validation">If you received a validation letter</h2>
		<p>It can be confusing and even scary to receive letters or messages from the CRA, and we understand that! They're to help ensure you keep getting your benefits.</p>
		<p> It is important to read these communications carefully, however, as the CRA may be seeking validation of eligibility criteria for a benefit that you have recently applied for or already received. The CRA relies in part on information that is already on file
			to validate or confirm eligibility of applicants. If you receive a letter or message from the CRA it may simply mean that more information is needed to complete your benefit application, or verify you eligibility. We need the right information on file.</p>
		<p>Individuals may be asked to provide more information or documentation at the time of application, or even after receiving the benefit.</p>
<h3>Why you may have received one</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Collect misssing information</li>
				<li>Confirming the primary caregiver related to children in your care</li>
				<li>Updating your contact information (e.g. your address)</li>
			</ul>	
<h3>What you can do once you’ve received one</h3>
