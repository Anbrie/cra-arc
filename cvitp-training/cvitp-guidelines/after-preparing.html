  <p>A Community Volunteer Income Tax  Program (CVITP) volunteer can take on many different roles. The following  guidelines will provide you with suggestions and tips to help you succeed whether you  prepare tax returns or provide support.</p>

<section class="alert alert-info">
  <p>To ensure the program's success, organizations and volunteers must safeguard taxpayer information and understand their responsibilities in this respect.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Do not use or disclose the individual's information for any purpose other than to complete their return</li>
    <li>Store the individual's information securely in a locked drawer or cabinet and never leave  their information unattended</li>
    <li>Be mindful of your surroundings when speaking with individuals, especially in a virtual clinic setting when other people are present in your home or you have technological devices such as Google Home or Alexa</li>
    <li>In the event of any type of security breach, such as lost, stolen or compromised data, tell your community organization and your Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) coordinator immediately</li>
  </ul>

    <li><a href="#h2">Clear all user information from UFile</a></li>
    <li><a href="#h3">What comes next</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Once the tax return  has been prepared and transmitted, follow these guidelines to ensure you have  successfully EFILED the return and safeguarded taxpayer information.</p>
  <h2 id="h1">Return all  documentation to the individual</h2>
  <p>Do not keep any of  the individual&rsquo;s documents (paper or electronic). This includes the completed  TIS60 and any calculations or notes you may have made while working.</p>
  <h2 id="h2">Clear all user  information from UFile </h2>
  <p> If you work on a computer  that you shared with other volunteers within your organization, be sure to  clear all of your user information at the end of your shift. Refer to finalizing  and sending the return.</p>
  <h2 id="h3"> What comes next</h2>
  <p>Individuals may ask to make an  adjustment to their tax return. As a CVITP volunteer you are not expected to  assist with adjustments, however if you choose to assist the individual keep  the following information in mind.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>An individual must wait to receive their notice of assessment for the tax  year needing a change before requesting the adjustment.</li>
    <li>Generally, a change can be made to a return for a tax year ending in any of  the ten previous calendar years. For example, a request made in 2021 must  relate to the 2011 or a later tax year to be considered.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The individual must have:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>their       notice of assessment for the tax year requiring the adjustment</li>
    <li>a copy       of their tax return with all amounts reported</li>
    <li>any       receipts or tax slips supporting the adjustment </li>
  </ul>
  <p>To request a change, the  individual must complete, sign and date form <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t1-adj.html">T1-ADJ T1 Adjustment Request</a>. Volunteers can choose to assist the  individual but cannot act as their representative. Instructions on how to  complete form T1-ADJ can be found on the back of the form.</p>
  <p> The individual can expect  delays of 10 to 12 weeks on processing paper T1 adjustments. </p>
<p>If an individual returns to the organization  with follow-up questions about their return, refer them to the CRA&rsquo;s Individual  tax enquiries line, 1-800-959-8281. For any questions  about tax refunds, refer them to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/refunds.html">Tax refunds: When to expect your refund</a>.</p>
