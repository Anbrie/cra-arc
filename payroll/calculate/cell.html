<h2 id="h_3">Determine if the benefit is taxable</h2>
<h3 id="h_3_1">Allowances you provide to your employees for cell phone and internet services</h3>
<span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li"></span> <p>The CRA's administrative policy does not apply if you give your employee an <strong>allowance </strong>for cell phone and internet services, the benefits are <strong>always </strong>taxable. </p>
<p>For more information on how to calculate the benefit, see <a href="#h_4">Calculate the value of the benefit</a>.</p>
<h3 id="h_3_2">Cell phones you provide to your employees</h3>
<span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> <p>Under the CRA's administrative policy, if you provide your employee with a cell phone (or other handheld communication device) that you own and you require your employee to use the cell phone as part of their employment duties, the fair market value (FMV) of the cell phone or device is <strong>not </strong>a taxable benefit.</p>
<h3 id="h_3_3">Cell phone service plans (including data) you provide or reimburse to your employees </h3>
<span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> <p>Under the CRA's administrative policy, if you provide an employee with cell phone service plans (including data), the FMV of the benefit is <strong>not </strong>taxable if all of the following apply: </p>

<ul>
<li>you require your employee to use the cell phone service plans as part of their employment duties </li>
<li>the plan has a reasonable <strong>fixed cost</strong> </li>
<li>your employee's personal use of the service <strong>does not result in additional charges </strong>(the total charges are not more than the plan cost)  </li>
</ul>
<p>/<strong>Where additional charges are incurred in excess of the price of the plan </strong>as a result of the employee's <strong>personal use</strong>, it is a taxable benefit unless the employee reimburses you for the additional charges. For more information on how to calculate the benefit, see Calculate the value of the benefit.</p>
<h4>Records to keep</h4>
<p>You must also be prepared to justify your position regarding the cost of the plan being reasonable. When determining whether a plan is reasonable or not, judgement should be made in respect of the employee's employment related needs. A more expensive plan may be considered reasonable if the employee requires that service in order to perform their regular duties of employment. </p>
<h3 id="h_3_4">Cell phones purchased by the employee and you reimbursed them </h3>
<span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li"></span> <p>The CRA's administrative policy does not apply if you reimburse your employee for the cost of their own cell phone (or other handheld communication device), the FMV of the cell phone or device is a taxable benefit.  This is the case even if the employee used, lost, or damaged the cell phone or device while carrying out their employment duties. </p>
<p>If the plan cost includes both the purchase of the phone and service, <strong>and the plan meets all conditions</strong>, only the part for the purchase of the phone is a taxable benefit. For the conditions, see Cell phone service plans you provide or reimburse to your employees.</p>
<p>For more information on how to calculate the benefit, see <a href="#h_4">Calculate the value of the benefit</a>.</p>
<h3 id="h_3_5">Internet services you provide or reimburse to your employees </h3>
<span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li"></span> <p>The CRA's administrative policy does not apply if you provide or reimburse your employee for the cost of internet services, the <strong>personal use </strong>of the service is taxable. </p>
<p>However, the business use portion is <strong>not </strong>a taxable benefit.</p>
<p>For more information on how to calculate the benefit, see <a href="#h_4">Calculate the value of the benefit</a>.</p>
<h3 id="h_3_6">Long distance phone calls you reimburse to your employees </h3>
<span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> <p>The CRA's administrative policy applies if you reimburse your employee for personal long distance telephone calls, the benefit is <strong>not </strong>taxable if <strong>one </strong>of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>they relate to selling the employee's old residence <strong>and </strong>they are in respect of the moving or relocation of the employee, the employee's family, and their household effects to one of the employer's places of business </li>
<li>in respect of moving or relocating the employee, the employee's family, and their household effects out of a <strong>remote work location </strong>after the employment is finished </li>
</ul>
<p>For more information, see <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/payroll/benefits-allowances/provided/moving-expenses-relocation-benefits/moving-expenses-paid-employer-that-a-taxable-benefit.html">Moving expenses and relocation benefits</a>.</p>
<h2 id="h_4">Calculate the value of the benefit</h2>
<p><strong>If the benefit is taxable</strong>, the value of the benefit is equal to the fair market value (FMV) of the employee's <strong>personal use </strong>of:</p>

<ul>
<li>the cell phone or the cell phone service plans </li>
<li>internet service plans </li>
<li><strong>minus </strong>any amounts your employee reimburses you </li>
</ul>
<p>The business use portion of the service is <strong>not </strong>a taxable benefit.</p>
