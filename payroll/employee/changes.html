<p>Your employee may want to increase or reduce income tax deductions. Your employee's life situation may also change their personal tax credits. </p>

 
 <details>
<summary>Situation: Individual wants to increase income tax deductions</span></summary>

<p>Individuals may want to increase income tax deductions to avoid having to pay a large amount of tax when they file their income tax and benefit return. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>individual works part-time for different employers during the year </li>
<li>individual no longer pays for child care </li>
<li>individual's province of employment is not the same as their province of residence and they will not have enough tax deducted </li>
</ul>
<h4>How to increase</h4>
<p>To increase income tax deductions, the individual must complete <strong>revised TD1 forms</strong>: <a href="td1.html">Get the completed TD1 forms</a></p>
		 

		 </details>

<details>
<summary>Situation: Individual wants to reduce income tax deductions</span></summary>
<p>There are many other deductions from income, or non-refundable tax credits that are not part of the TD1 form that may be used to reduce income tax deducted at source. These require the <strong>employee </strong>to apply for a <strong>letter of authority</strong>. A letter of authority from the CRA is required when employees wants to reduce income tax deductions in the following situations:</p>

<ul>
<li>individual makes charitable donations to registered charities or other qualified donees </li>
<li>individual has employment-related expenses </li>
<li>individual pays for child care </li>
<li>individual makes deductible RRSP contributions himself during the year </li>
<li>individual's province of employment is not the same as their province of residence and they will have too much tax deducted </li>
</ul>
<h4>How to reduce</h4>	      
<p>To reduce income tax deductions, the individual must get a </strong>letter of authority (tax waiver)</strong>. The individual must send, either:</p>

<ul>
<li>a Form <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t1213.html">T1213</a>, Request to Reduce Tax Deductions at Source </li>
<li>a written request that supports their position why less tax should be deducted at source </li>
</ul></details>

<details>
<summary>Situation: Employer or payer wants to reduce income tax deduction (blanket waiver for $15,000 or less)</span></summary>	      

<p>You may request blanket waivers when both of the following occur:</p>

<ul>
<li>you will be making a lump-sum payment to your employees </li>
<li>you anticipate that your employees will want to contribute all or a portion of the lump-sum payment into an RRSP </li>
</ul>
<p>Blanket waivers, when applicable, eliminate the need for each employee to request a letter of authority. If approved by the CRA, you will receive a blanket waiver letter providing the details of the approval. You will also receive a <strong>declaration of intent </strong>form to be provided for each applicable employee. This form is completed by each employee and given to the employer to confirm that the employee <strong>will be </strong>contributing to an RRSP.</p>
<h3>What to do once you received the blanket waiver letter from the CRA</h3>
<p>When receiving the blanket waiver letter and <strong>completed </strong>declaration of intent forms, the employer or payer must:</p>

<ul>
<li>retain a copy of the blanket waiver letter and completed declaration of intent forms for their payroll records</li>
<li>reduce the lump sum payment by the amount on the declaration of intent in order to calculate the <strong>taxable </strong>amount of the lump sum payment </li>
</ul>
