  <p>A Community Volunteer Income Tax  Program (CVITP) volunteer can take on many different roles. The following  guidelines will provide you with suggestions and tips to help you succeed whether you  prepare tax returns or provide support.</p>

<section class="alert alert-info">
  <p>To ensure the program's success, organizations and volunteers must safeguard taxpayer information and understand their responsibilities in this respect.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Do not use or disclose the individual's information for any purpose other than to complete their return</li>
    <li>Store the individual's information securely in a locked drawer or cabinet and never leave  their information unattended</li>
    <li>Be mindful of your surroundings when speaking with individuals, especially in a virtual clinic setting when other people are present in your home or you have technological devices such as Google Home or Alexa</li>
    <li>In the event of any type of security breach, such as lost, stolen or compromised data, tell your community organization and your Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) coordinator immediately</li>

  <h2 id="h1">Completing Section II of form TIS60</h2>
  <p>Section II of form TIS60 is&nbsp;<strong>only applicable</strong>&nbsp;if  the return will be electronically filed (EFILED). It must be completed and  signed by both you and the individual.</p>
  <p> UFile&nbsp;CVITP&nbsp;will  automatically generate form TIS60. You can also find this form under&nbsp;Tools  and references in the <strong>Useful forms, job aids and fact sheets</strong>&nbsp;section.</p>
  <p> If you do not have the ability to print forms, you can  get hard copies of the TIS60 by contacting your&nbsp;CRA&nbsp;coordinator or by  calling the dedicated help line for volunteers.  </p>

  <p><strong>Completing  section II of   TIS60 in a virtual  clinic</strong><strong> </strong></p>
  <p>    If you are participating in a virtual clinic, you have two options  to complete the signing  of section II of TIS60.</p>
  <p> <strong>Option 1</strong></p>
  <p>    Send the TIS60 via  password protected email to the individual with Part C completed.</p>
  <p> <strong>Email communication</strong></p>
  <p>    First, send a generic email to the individual to  ensure they understand that email is not a secure method of communication, and  also to ensure you have the correct email address. </p>
  <p> To protect your privacy, use a separate email  account and block your number from being displayed when communicating with  taxpayers. If the individual replies, providing consent and confirming the  address is correct, proceed with further communication. </p>
  <p> Use email only as an option for obtaining consent  to file the TIS60 electronically. Avoid using email or social media channels to  prepare an individual&rsquo;s return. </p>
  <p><strong>Sample of generic  email</strong> </p>
  <p>    Hello, </p>
  <p> Due to concerns  surrounding COVID-19, (organization name) is unable to host tax clinics in  person. Therefore, I would like to communicate with you via email which is an  unsecure method of communication and that all efforts will be made to ensure  that your personal information is protected throughout our correspondences. We  would like to confirm that we will not be saving any personal information and  all emails will be deleted upon filing your return. Please reply to this email  to continue using email to correspond with me, a CVITP volunteer, in order to  complete your income tax and benefit return(s). </p>
  <p> Thank you, </p>
  <p> (insert name of  CVITP volunteer)&nbsp; </p>
  <p><strong>PDF password  protection </strong></p>
  <p>    Use password protection on the PDF version of the  tax return or TIS60. A PDF reader is required to send or receive a password  protected PDF. For instructions, refer to Navigating through the CVITP tax software.</p>
  <p> Provide the password to the individual over the  phone, via text message or in a separate email. </p>
  <p> Send the password protected PDF to the individual  as an email attachment. Do not include the password in the same email as the  document(s).</p>
  <p> Advise the individual to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>print, sign Part D, scan and email the form back to  you</li>
    <li>print, sign Part D, take a picture and email or  text it back to you </li>
    <li>print, sign Part D and show you the form on camera  using video conferencing n </li>
    <li>electronically sign Part D of the form and email it  back to you </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Option 2</strong></p>
  <p>    Provide a copy of the TIS60 with Part C completed  to the organization. The organization can arrange to have the individual sign  Part D and can notify you once the form has been signed. The individual would  retain the signed copy for their records.</p>
  <p> If option 1 or 2 is not possible, obtain verbal  authorization from the individual by reading the following: </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Before I file your  return, please confirm the amounts I am about to share with you are correct and  complete, and that you have fully disclosed your income from all sources. Also,  please confirm that you authorize me to file your return electronically </li>
      <li>Based on the  information you provided: 
      <ul>
        <li>your total income is  $XXXX, </li>
        <li>your taxable income  is $XXXX, </li>
        <li>your total  non-refundable tax credits are $XXXX, and </li>
        <li>you have a balance  owing/refund of $XXXX. </li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>Do you authorize me  to EFILE your return with the amounts I just read to you?</li>
    </ul>

  <p>Once the individual signs the TIS60 or you have  obtained their verbal consent, EFILE the return. If the return cannot be  transmitted, print a paper copy of the return for the individual and ask them to  mail it to the CRA for processing. Refer to Find a CRA address  to ensure that you provide them with the correct  mailing address for their applicable Tax Centre.</p>

<section class="alert alert-info">	
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Always</strong>&nbsp;give the completed    TIS60 to the individual for their records</li>
          <li>Do&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;tell the individual to send it to    the&nbsp;CRA</li>
          <li><strong>Never</strong>&nbsp;keep a copy of the    TIS60 or send it to a&nbsp;CRA&nbsp;coordinator</li>
        </ul>
</section>		  
  <h2 id="h2">Transmitting the return </h2>
  <p>Each person's return  must be transmitted individually, immediately  upon completion. For step-by-step instructions on how to transmit the  return using UFile CVITP, go to Finalizing and sending the return under Navigating through the CVITP tax software.</p>
  <p> There may be  circumstances when it may not be possible to transmit a return immediately upon  completion such as in clinic locations where internet isn&rsquo;t available. </p>
  <p> In instances where  you are unable to transmit a return immediately, ensure that you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Always</strong> encrypt returns using the tax software and save  the files on a USB flash drive <strong>only</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Never</strong> save a copy of the individual's return on the hard  drive of your computer </li>
    <li>delete the saved return no more than <strong>48 hours  after the transmission has been accepted</strong> by the CRA </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="h3">Providing the tax return and forms </h2>
  <p>Although the CRA  encourages electronic filing, it also recognizes that you may need to provide  specific pages or a copy of the tax return to an individual. You can either  save them as a PDF or print them for the individual. Refer to finalizing  and sending the return under Navigating through the CVITP tax software. </p>
  <p> If you print tax  returns or other documents containing the individual's information using a  shared printer, ensure that you pick them up promptly. Do not leave them on the printer for others to see.</p>
<section class="alert alert-info">
	<p>Some printers,    scanners, and copiers may retain memory. If you are using a personal printer that retains    memory, make sure you clear the memory regularly. If you are using a shared printer, your organization    will ensure that the memory is cleared regularly.</p>
</section>	
  <h2 id="h4">Paper returns </h2>
  <p>If you prepare paper  returns:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>add all box numbers for the same type of income  slips and enter the totals on the applicable lines on the paper return  (for example, add up the amounts in  box&nbsp;14 for all of an individual's T4&nbsp;slips and enter the total on  line&nbsp;10100) </li>
    <li>ensure the individual signs the tax return at the  bottom of page&nbsp;8 </li>
    <li>enter a 1 in box 48700 at the bottom of page&nbsp;8  of the tax return to indicate that it was prepared by a volunteer; this field  is automatically completed when the return is prepared using UFile CVITP </li>
    <li>attach all completed schedules, information slips,  required forms, and receipts </li>
    <li>instruct the individual to mail their paper return  to the applicable <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information/tax-centres.html" target="_blank">tax centre</a></li>
    <li>remind the individual to mail their return by the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/campaigns/covid-19-update/covid-19-filing-payment-dates.html" target="_blank">filing  deadline</a> to avoid possible late filing penalties or delays  in the processing of their benefit payments</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If an individual  wants to know when they can reasonably expect to receive their tax assessment  you can refer to service  standards in the CRA for the most current timeframes. </p>
