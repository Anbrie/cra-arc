<details><summary>Calculation example &ndash; First or once-a-year bonus payment</summary>
<p>Donna earns a salary of $400 per week. In September, you gave her a bonus of $300. Her province of employment is British Columbia. The claim code that applies to her TD1 and TD1BC forms is "1."</p>
<p>Divide the bonus by the number of pay periods in the year ($300 ÷ 52 = $5.77).</p>
<p>Add the $5.77 to the current pay rate of $400. As a result, the adjusted pay rate for the year is $405.77 per week.</p>
<p>In the payroll deductions tables, choose the weekly tables (52 pay periods a year) to find the increased weekly federal and provincial tax you should deduct on the additional $5.77 per week.</p>
<p>Find the federal and provincial tax that you deduct on $405.77 per week. </p>
<p>Subtract the federal and provincial tax that you deduct on $400 per week. </p>
<p>The result is the tax you have to deduct on the additional $5.77 per week.</p>
<p>Multiply the additional tax you deduct per week by 52 (the number of pay periods in the year). This gives you the amount of income tax to deduct from the bonus of $300.</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Situation - Result of the calculation is more than $5,000 and it is more than one bonus payment in the year</summary>
<ol class="lst-stps stps-strpd">
<li><strong>Previous</strong> bonus payment ÷ number of pay periods in the year</li>
<li>Amount from Step 1 + regular salary for the pay period = Adjusted pay rate for <strong>previous </strong>bonus</li>
<li><strong>Current </strong>bonus payment ÷ number of pay periods in the year </li>
<li>Amount from Step 3 + previous adjusted pay rate (from step 2) = Total adjusted pay rate</li>
<li>Get the tax deduction for the total adjusted pay rate (from Step 4) from the applicable federal and provincial tax table</li>
<li>Determine the amount of tax to deduct from the previous adjusted pay rate (from step 2)</li>
<li>Total adjusted pay tax deduction (from step 5) - previous adjusted pay deduction (from step 6)</li>
<li>Multiply the result from step 7 by the number of pay periods in the year. </li>
<li>This is the tax to be deducted from the second bonus payment.</li>

<p>For any additional bonuses in the year, you need to follow the same steps and you need to take into account all previous payments.</p>
  
<details><summary>Calculation example &ndash; More than one bonus payment a year</summary>
<p>Mario earns a salary of $400 per week (<strong>amount 1</strong>). You paid him bonuses of $300 in January and $780 in February. His province of employment is Alberta. The claim code that applies to his TD1 and TD1AB forms is "1."</p>
<p>The calculation must take into account <strong>all </strong>bonuses you paid during the year. You have to calculate the amount of tax to deduct for the entire year, regardless of when you paid the bonus.</p>
<p>Divide the bonus you paid in January by the number of pay periods in the year ($300 ÷ 52 = $5.77) (<strong>amount 2</strong>). Add the $5.77 to the weekly salary of $400 to determine the adjusted weekly pay before the February bonus ($400 + $5.77 = $405.77).</p>
<p>Divide the <strong>last </strong>bonus you paid to Mario by the number of pay periods in the year ($780 ÷ 52 = $15) (<strong>amount 3</strong>). Add amounts 1, 2, and 3 to determine the adjusted weekly pay for the year of $420.77 ($400 + $5.77 + $15).</p>
<p>In the payroll deductions tables, choose the weekly tables (52 pay periods a year) to find the increased weekly federal and provincial tax you should deduct on the additional $15 per week.</p>
<p>Find the federal and provincial tax that you deduct on $420.77 per week. </p>
<p>Subtract the federal and provincial tax that you deduct on $405.77 per week. </p>
<p>The result is the tax you have to deduct on the additional $15.</p>
<p>Multiply the additional tax per week by 52 to determine the amount to deduct on the bonus of $780.</p>

<details><summary>Situation - Result of the calculation is more than $5,000 and it is a retroactive pay increase</summary>
<ol class="lst-stps stps-strpd">
<li></li>

<li></li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<details><summary>Calculation example &ndash; Retroactive pay increase</summary>
<p>Irene's pay increased from $440 to $460 per week. The increase was retroactive to 12 weeks, which gives her a total retroactive payment of $240 (12 × $20). Her province of employment is Nova Scotia. The claim code that applies to her TD1 and TD1NS forms is "6."</p>
<p>In the payroll deductions tables, choose the weekly tables (52 pay periods a year) to find the increase in the weekly federal and provincial tax that you should deduct because of the increased pay rate.</p>
<p>Find the federal and provincial tax that you deduct on $460 per week. </p>
<p>Subtract the federal and provincial tax that you deduct on $440 per week.</p>
<p>The result is the tax you have to deduct on the additional $20 per week.</p>
<p>Multiply the increase in the weekly tax that you deduct by the number of weeks to which the retroactive pay increase applies.</p>
<p>This amount is the tax that you must deduct from the retroactive payment.</p>
