<li>remits <strong>monthly, </strong>the PD7A(TM) is sent as soon as a payment is received. If a payment is not made, the PD7A(TM) is generally sent the 18th of the month. </li>

<details><summary>Remittance voucher for Payment on Filing (PoF) Source Deductions (PD7R)</summary>
<h3>What is a PD7R</h3>
<p>The PD7R is a payment voucher that is generated as per your request. You can <strong>only </strong>request a PD7R <strong>if you are eligible </strong>to make a <strong>reconciliation payment </strong>by the last day of February without being subject to penalty or interest.</p>

<h3>Eligibility to use the PoF</h3>
<p>Eligibility is applied to businesses separately. If you own multiple businesses, you may have businesses that are eligible and some that are not. If you use the PoF and you are not eligible, penalties and interest will be applied. </p>
<p>You are eligible to use PoF if you meet <strong>all </strong>of the following 3 criteria:</p>

<ul>
<li>The reconciliation payment is less than <strong>1% </strong>of the total annual remittances </li>
<li>Payroll compliance is perfect which means <strong>all </strong>of the following apply:
<ul>
<li>no late or outstanding remittances </li>
<li>no assessments in the filing year </li>
<li>all T4 information returns are filed on time </li>
</ul>
