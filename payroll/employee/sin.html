  </ul>

<h2 id="h-1">Who should provide their SINs</h2>
<p>Individuals <strong>must </strong>obtain and provide the 9-digit number known as a Social Insurance Number (SIN). </p>
<p>Service Canada is responsible for issuing SINs when starting employment.</p>

<p>A temporary SIN is issued to visitors, permit holders, refugees, and temporary workers who are legally entitled to work in Canada. These numbers begin with a 9 and have an expiry date.</p>
<p>Learn more on the <strong>individual's responsibilities to obtain a SIN prior to working in Canada from Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC)</strong>: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/sin/qualify.html">Who needs a Social Insurance Number (SIN)</a><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/sin/qualify.html">.</a></p>

<h2 id="h-2">When to get the SIN from the individual</h2>
<p>You have to get the social insurance number (SIN) from the individual <strong>within three days </strong>of when they start to work for you.</p>
<p>Learn more on your <strong>responsibilities related to your employee's SIN</strong> from Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC), <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/ei/ei-list/ei-employers-sin.html">Employer information - Social Insurance Number (SIN)</a><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/sin/qualify.html"></a></p>

<h2 id="h-3">What if you do not receive the SIN from the individual</h2>		 
<p>If the individual does not give you their SIN, you need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Show that you made a <strong>reasonable effort </strong>to get it (if you do not make a reasonable effort to get a SIN, you may have to pay a penalty of $100 for each number you don't try to get) </li>
<li>Inform Service Canada <strong>within six days </strong>of the individual starting to work for you that they did not give their SIN </li>
<li>Suggest to your employee to contact Service Canada and consult <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/sin/qualify.html">Who needs a SIN.</a>  Example of a reasonable effort </li>
</ul>
<p>After asking the individual for their SIN many times, you decide to contact them in writing to request their SIN. You made notes of the dates you asked for the SIN verbally, and keep copies of any written requests.</p>

  </li>
</ul>
	   
<h2 id="h-4">After receiving the SIN</h2>
<p>Make sure the employee gives you their correct name and SIN. You may ask for other types of identification, such as a birth certificate or a certificate of citizenship or permanent residence, before finalizing their employment documents. <strong>An incorrect SIN can affect an employee's future Canada Pension Plan benefits if their record of earnings is not accurate</strong>. </p>

<details><summary>Situation: Individual is a non-resident</summary>
	
<p id="after">You need to make sure that all individuals who have a SIN beginning with a "9" are authorized to work in Canada and that their work permit has not expired. </p>
<p>If the immigration document has expired, ask the employee to contact Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada to get a valid document. You can advise your employee to consult, <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/sin/receiving-updating.html">What to do if your temporary SIN expires</a>).</p>
<p>For more information about hiring or extending the work of temporary foreign workers, go to IRCC's <a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/hire/index.asp">Hire foreign workers</a>. </p>
<p>Keep the completed forms with your employee's records. <strong>Do not </strong>send us a copy.</p>
