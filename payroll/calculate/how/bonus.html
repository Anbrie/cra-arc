<h1 property="name" id="wb-cont" class="gc-thickline">Calculations of bonuses, retroactive payments or irregular amounts</h1>
<p>In addition to the regular types of payments such as salary, wages, etc., you may pay employees other types of payments. For example: </p>

<ul>
<li>Bonus (for example, an incentive payment made at the end of a fiscal or calendar year)</li>
<li>Retroactive pay (for example, a backdated increase in pay after a new contract is finalized)</li>
<li>Other types of irregular payments </li>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
  <li class="cnjnctn-col">
    <h4 class="mrgn-tp-sm text-muted h4">Use the bonus method</h4>
      <p>If the payment is made <strong>separately </strong>from regular pay, use the bonus method to calculate manually</p>

  </li>
  <li class="cnjnctn-col">
    <h4 class="mrgn-tp-sm text-muted h4">Do not use the bonus method</h4>
  <p>If the payment is made <strong>with </strong>regular pay, use: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-businesses/payroll-deductions-online-calculator.html?utm_campaign=not-applicable&amp;utm_medium=vanity-url&amp;utm_source=canada-ca_pdoc">Payroll Deductions Online Calculator (PDOC)</a> or <a href="tables.html">CPP, EI and income tax deductions tables</a></p>
 
  </li>
</ul>


<h2 id="h_2">Why use this bonus method</h2>
<p>This method will result in a tax deduction that better estimates the amount of tax the individual will owe on the employment income when filing their personal income tax return. Using the bonus method provides a fairer tax deduction because the payment is spread over the year and taxed accordingly.</p>

<h2 id="h_3">Determine the CPP contributions to withhold</h2>
<p>You have to deduct CPP contributions from bonuses and retroactive pay increases.</p> 

<p>If the payment is made <strong>separately</strong> from regular pay, no exemption is included and you must use one of the following methods:</p>

<ul class="fa-ul">

<li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li fa-lg"> </span> <a href="software.html">Formulas for employers using software programs</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Bonus method - How to calculate</h3>
<p>The bonus method does not take into consideration the basic exemption.</p> 
<ol class="lst-stps stps-strpd">

<li><p>For current employees or pensioners, determine if you need to <strong>stop</strong> deducting CPP because the employee reached the <strong>maximum</strong> contribution for the <strong>year</strong>.</p>
<p>This applies to <strong>each job </strong>the employee holds with <strong>different employers </strong>(different business numbers). If an employee leaves one employer during the year to start work with another employer, the new employer also has to deduct CPP contributions without taking into account what the previous employer paid. This is the case even if the employee has contributed the maximum amount during the previous employment. </p>

<details><summary>Calculation example</summary>
<p>Joseph receives a retroactive pay increase of $450.00 on June 29. His payroll record for the year indicates that, to date, you have deducted $300.00 in CPP contributions.</p>
<p>Maximum CPP contribution for the year (2021) is $3,166.45</p>
<p><strong>Minus: </strong>Contributions to date for the year of $300.00</p>
<p>Equals the maximum that you can deduct for Joseph for the rest of the year, which is $2,866.45</p>
<p>Retroactive pay increase ($450.00) × CPP rate (5.45%) = CPP contributions from Joseph's retroactive pay ($24.53)</p>
<p>You should deduct CPP contributions of $24.53 from Joseph's retroactive pay increase up to the maximum for the year.</p>

<p>The amount deducted is dependent on the frequency of when the bonus is paid within a year</a></p>
 
<details><summary>Calculation example &ndash; First or once-a-year bonus payment</summary>
<p>Donna earns a salary of $400 per week. In September, you gave her a bonus of $300. Her province of employment is British Columbia. The claim code that applies to her TD1 and TD1BC forms is "1."</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Divide the bonus by the number of pay periods in the year ($300 ÷ 52 = $5.77).</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Add the $5.77 to the current pay rate of $400. As a result, the adjusted pay rate for the year is $405.77 per week.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: </strong>In <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/payroll/t4032-payroll-deductions-tables.html">Guide T4032, Payroll Deductions Tables</a>, choose the weekly tables (52 pay periods a year) from Sections D and E to find the increased weekly federal and provincial tax you should deduct on the additional $5.77 per week.</p>
<p><strong>Calculate as follows:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Find the federal and provincial tax that you deduct on $405.77 per week. </li>
<li>Subtract the federal and provincial tax that you deduct on $400 per week. </li>
</ul>
<p>The result is the tax you have to deduct on the additional $5.77 per week.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: </strong>Multiply the additional tax you deduct per week by 52 (the number of pay periods in the year). This gives you the amount of income tax to deduct from the bonus of $300.</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Calculation example &ndash; More than one bonus payment a year</summary>
<p>Mario earns a salary of $400 per week (<strong>amount 1</strong>). You paid him bonuses of $300 in January and $780 in February. His province of employment is Alberta. The claim code that applies to his TD1 and TD1AB forms is "1."</p>
<p>The calculation must take into account <strong>all </strong>bonuses you paid during the year. You have to calculate the amount of tax to deduct for the entire year, regardless of when you paid the bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Divide the bonus you paid in January by the number of pay periods in the year ($300 ÷ 52 = $5.77) (<strong>amount 2</strong>). Add the $5.77 to the weekly salary of $400 to determine the adjusted weekly pay before the February bonus ($400 + $5.77 = $405.77).</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Divide the <strong>last </strong>bonus you paid to Mario by the number of pay periods in the year ($780 ÷ 52 = $15) (<strong>amount 3</strong>). Add amounts 1, 2, and 3 to determine the adjusted weekly pay for the year of $420.77 ($400 + $5.77 + $15).</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: </strong>In <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/payroll/t4032-payroll-deductions-tables.html">Guide T4032, Payroll Deductions Tables</a>, choose the weekly tables (52 pay periods a year) from Sections D and E to find the increased weekly federal and provincial tax you should deduct on the additional $15 per week.</p>
<p><strong>Calculate as follows:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Find the federal and provincial tax that you deduct on $420.77 per week. </li>
<li>Subtract the federal and provincial tax that you deduct on $405.77 per week. </li>
</ul>
<p>The result is the tax you have to deduct on the additional $15.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: </strong>Multiply the additional tax per week by 52 to determine the amount to deduct on the bonus of $780.</p>
<p>To calculate tax on additional bonuses, <strong>repeat steps 1 to 4</strong>.</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Calculation example &ndash; Retroactive pay increase</summary>
<p>Irene's pay increased from $440 to $460 per week. The increase was retroactive to 12 weeks, which gives her a total retroactive payment of $240 (12 × $20). Her province of employment is Nova Scotia. The claim code that applies to her TD1 and TD1NS forms is "6."</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: </strong>In <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/payroll/t4032-payroll-deductions-tables.html">Guide T4032, Payroll Deductions Tables</a>, choose the weekly tables (52 pay periods a year) from Sections D and E to find the increase in the weekly federal and provincial tax that you should deduct because of the increased pay rate.</p>
<p><strong>Calculate as follows:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Find the federal and provincial tax that you deduct on $460 per week. </li>
<li>Subtract the federal and provincial tax that you deduct on $440 per week. </li>
</ul>
<p>The result is the tax you have to deduct on the additional $20 per week.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Multiply the increase in the weekly tax that you deduct by the number of weeks to which the retroactive pay increase applies. This amount is the tax that you must deduct from the retroactive payment.</p>
