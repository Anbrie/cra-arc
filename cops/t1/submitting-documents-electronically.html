        <h2 id="gnrl">General information</h2>
<p>If you are asked for supporting documents by one of our programs, you or your authorized representative can send the documents to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA)&nbsp;online using our secure online service portals (<a href="account-individuals.html">My Account for Individuals</a> or <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/represent-a-client.html">Represent a Client</a>).</p>
<p>This secure and reliable service makes sending documents to the CRA easier and more efficient. It allows you to keep your original receipts, forms, and other documents. You will get a confirmation number and a reference number to use in future communications with the CRA.</p>

        <h3>Individuals</h3>
<p>If you are not registered for My Account, go to <a href="account-individuals.html">My Account for Individuals</a>&nbsp;to register. Once you have completed the online registration, you should receive a CRA security code by mail within 5-10 days (15 days if you are outside Canada or the United States).</p>
<p>For step-by-step instructions on setting up your CRA user ID and password, go to <a href="registration-process-access-cra-login-services.html">Registration process to access the CRA login services</a>.</p>
<p>After you receive your security code, return to <a href="account-individuals.html">My Account for Individuals</a> and select the service you registered with. Follow the online instructions, and enter your security code when prompted. You will now be able to access all of the online services available. You can also authorize your representative online using the &quot;Authorize my representative&quot; service in&nbsp;<a href="account-individuals.html">My Account for Individuals</a>. Your authorized representative will be able to submit documents&nbsp;online on your behalf if you give them level 2 authorization.</p>

        <h3>Authorized Representatives</h3>
<p>You may submit documents on behalf of a client, family member, or friend using Represent a Client. To register for this service, go to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/represent-a-client.html">Represent a Client</a>. Once you have registered as an individual or business, you will receive a representative identifier (RepID). The RepID identifies you as a registered representative with the CRA. Give it to your client, family member, or friend so they can authorize you to access their tax account.</p>
