<section>
<header> Introduction

	<p> For Indigenous people in Canada there may be some forms or processes that are different for you. In general, tax obligations are the same as any other resident in Canada</p>
	<p> While we acknowledge that people prefer to not be referred to with the outdated terms, throughout the following text, for the purposes of the tax exemption under
		section 87 of the Indian Act, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) uses the term "Indian" because it has a legal meaning in the Indian Act.

	<h1>Getting Benefits and Credits</h1>

	<p> There are some benefits and credits that are only available if you file a tax return. It's worth filing even if your income is tax-exempt.</p>
	<p> For example, the following benefits and credits are available only if you have filed (and continue to file) a return.
		GST/HST Credit
		Canada Child Benefit (CCB)
		Disability Tax Credit
		Northern Residents Deduction
		Canada Workers Benefit</p>
	<head>Filing
	<p> You can file a basic T1, there is a variety of existing electronic filing software. If you have exempt income you can fill out the T90 form</p>
	<p> You may be eligible to use simplified returns called the <b>T1S-D, Credit and Benefit Return</b>, or the <b>Let Us Help You Get Your Benefits, Credit and Benefit Short Return</b>
		if you are registered under the <i>Indian Act</i>.
		You can use the <b>T1S-D, Credit and Benefit Return</b> only if <b>all</b> of the following apply:
		<ul type="disc">
			<li>you lived in Newfoundland and Labrador, Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, or Alberta on December 31 of the tax year</li>
			<li>all your income is tax exempt (except retroactive universal child care benefit payments, old age security pension payments, social assistance payments,
				and net federal supplements</li>
			<li>no tax was deducted from any of your income (except Canada Emergency Response Benefits)</li>
			<li>you did not receive any working income tax benefit advance payments in the tax year</li>
		</ul>
	<p> You can use the <b>Let Us Help You Get Your Benefits, Credit and Benefit Short Return</b> if you meet the eligibility criteria listed on the form and
		<b>all</b> the following apply:</p>
		<ul type="disc">
			<li>you were a resident of Canada throughout the year</li>
			<li>your taxable income is less than the basic personal amount for the province or territory that you lived on December 31 of the tax year</li>
			<li>you are not claiming the eligible educator school supply tax credit</li>
			<li>you are not filing this return for a deceased person</li>
		</ul>
	<p>These returns are not available to print from the CRA website. Your band council may already have some, or could order them for you. You can also ask a CRA outreach officer
		during a virtual outreach visit</p>
