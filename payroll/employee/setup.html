<p>Form TD1, Personal Tax Credits Return, must be completed when individuals start a new job so that employers or payers pay individuals accurately. This is used to calculate the amount of tax to be deducted from their employment income or other income, such as pension income.</p>

  </ul>

 <h2 id="h-00">Who should complete TD1 forms</h2>
<p>Individuals must complete the federal TD1, and if more than the basic personal amount is claimed, the provincial or territorial TD1 in one of the following situations: </p>

<ul>
<li>have a new employer or payer </li>
<li>want to change amounts from previous claimed </li>
<li>want to claim the deduction for living in a prescribed zone </li>
<li>want to increase the amount of tax deducted at source </li>
</ul>
	

	

		 <h2 id="h-0">When to complete the TD1 forms</h2> 
 <p>Employers and payers must get the completed TD1 forms from the individual <strong>within seven days</strong> in either situation:</p>
<ul>
	<li>starting employment</li>
	<li>when a change happens to the individual's personal tax credits</li></ul>
<details>
<summary>Situation: Individual want's to increase income tax deductions</span></summary>

<p>Individuals may want to increase income tax deductions to avoid having to pay a large amount of tax when they file their income tax and benefit return. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>individual works part-time for different employers during the year </li>
<li>individual no longer pays for child care </li>
<li>individual's province of employment is not the same as their province of residence and they will not have enough tax deducted </li>
</ul>
<h4>How to increase</h4>
<p>To increase income tax deductions, the individual must complete <strong>revised TD1 forms</strong>.</p>
		 

		 </details>

<details>
<summary>Situation: Individual want's to reduce income tax deductions</span></summary>
<p>There are many other deductions from income, or non-refundable tax credits that are not part of the TD1 form that may be used to reduce income tax deducted at source. These require the <strong>employee </strong>to apply for a <strong>letter of authority</strong>. A letter of authority from the CRA is required when employees wants to reduce income tax deductions in the following situations:</p>

<ul>
<li>individual makes charitable donations to registered charities or other qualified donees </li>
<li>individual has employment-related expenses </li>
<li>individual pays for child care </li>
<li>individual makes deductible RRSP contributions himself during the year </li>
<li>individual's province of employment is not the same as their province of residence and they will have too much tax deducted </li>
</ul>
<h4>How to reduce</h4>	      
<p>To reduce income tax deductions, the individual must get a </strong>letter of authority (tax waiver)</strong>. The individual must send, either:</p>

<ul>
<li>a Form <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t1213.html">T1213</a>, Request to Reduce Tax Deductions at Source </li>
<li>a written request that supports their position why less tax should be deducted at source </li>
</ul></details>

<details>
<summary>Situation: Employer or payer want's to reduce income tax deduction (blanket waiver for $15,000 or less)</span></summary>	      

<p>You may request blanket waivers when both of the following occur:</p>

<ul>
<li>you will be making a lump-sum payment to your employees </li>
<li>you anticipate that your employees will want to contribute all or a portion of the lump-sum payment into an RRSP </li>
</ul>
<p>Blanket waivers, when applicable, eliminate the need for each employee to request a letter of authority. If approved by the CRA, you will receive a blanket waiver letter providing the details of the approval. You will also receive a <strong>declaration of intent </strong>form to be provided for each applicable employee. This form is completed by each employee and given to the employer to confirm that the employee <strong>will be </strong>contributing to an RRSP.</p>
<h3>What to do once you received the blanket waiver letter from the CRA</h3>
<p>When receiving the blanket waiver letter and <strong>completed </strong>declaration of intent forms, the employer or payer must:</p>

<ul>
<li>retain a copy of the blanket waiver letter and completed declaration of intent forms for their payroll records</li>
<li>reduce the lump sum payment by the amount on the declaration of intent in order to calculate the <strong>taxable </strong>amount of the lump sum payment </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h-2">Electronic or paper TD1 forms</h2>
 <details> <summary>Electronic TD1 forms you created</summary>
<p>You may create a federal and/or provincial or territorial Form TD1, Personal Tax Credits Return, and have the individual send it to you electronically instead of giving paper copies of Form TD1 to the individual.</p>

<p>The following conditions must be met:</p> 
<ul><li>You can create, maintain and store the TD1 Personal Tax Credits Return forms electronically.</li>
<li>Security measures must be in place to authenticate the individual's identity because there is no written signature on the TD1 Form (for example, a password system or an individual self-service portal).</li></ul>
<p>In addition to the above conditions, the electronic forms must:</p>

<ul>
<li>be made available and accessible to the CRA when requested and be maintained in a format that can be read by representatives of the CRA. </li>
<li>mirrors the CRA approved TD1 paper form </li>
<li>include a certification confirming that the information given by the individual is accurate. For example, clicking on a button saying "I agree" to a statement that is similar to the certification statement on the paper Form TD1 return (i.e. the information is correct and complete to the best of his or her knowledge) </li>
<li>be in a format that cannot be altered. In other words changes can only be made if the individual submits a new Form TD1 </li>
<li>include a date so you can tell when the individual submits a new Form TD1 to you </li>
<li>meets all of the CRA's general guidelines on record retention and on electronic records, which can be found in information circular <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/ic78-10.html">IC78-10R, Books and Records Retention/Destruction</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>The use of the electronic form will not relieve you of your responsibility to review the completed forms for reasonableness. </p>
</details>
<details> <summary>Online or paper TD1 forms</summary>
<p>You can give the link to the webpage or give paper copies of the appropriate TD1 forms to the individual. </p>
</details>

 

 <h2 id="h-4">What if you do not receive the form</h2>

<p>If an individual does not give the completed Form TD1, the individual's tax deductions will only include the basic personal amount you estimated bases on their income. You still need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>determine which tax tables to use </li>
<li>calculate deductions and remit them by the due date </li></ul>
<h3>Penalties</h3>
<p>If the individual does provide you with a form, they may be penalized $25 for each day the form is late. The minimum penalty is $100, and increases by $25 per day to the maximum of $2,500.</p>


<h2 id="h-5">After receiving the forms</h2>
<p>You need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>review the back of the TD1 form to make sure the individual has not included any <strong>additional </strong>information (for example, requesting additional tax to be deducted). </li>
<li>review the back of the TD1 form to make sure the box <strong>More than one employer or payer at the same time </strong>is not checked. If the box is checked and the individuals' total income from all sources will be <strong>more </strong>than the personal tax credits claimed on another TD1 form, you must enter <strong>zero </strong>on the <strong>Total Claim Amount </strong>line. This is because individuals with multiple employers cannot claim the basic personal amount with more than <strong>one </strong>employer <strong>unless </strong>their combined annual earnings will be <strong>less </strong>than the basic personal amount </li>
<li>use the <strong>Total Claim Amount </strong>from the TD1 form to calculate the correct amount of federal and provincial or territorial income tax deductions </li>
<li>keep the completed forms with the individual's records. <strong>Do not </strong>send us a copy. </li>
<li>determine which tax tables to use </li>
<li>calculate deductions and remit them by the due date </li>
</ul>

<p>A new form will be required within <strong>seven days </strong>of any changes to the individual's personal tax credits. </p>
<h3>Your responsibility</h3>
<p>It is a serious offence to knowingly accept a TD1 that contains false or deceptive statements. If you think that the TD1 has false information, you should ask for proof from the individual such as proof of age and/or address If you think that the TD1 has false information, you must deduct taxes after allowing the basic personal amount <strong>only</strong>.</p>
