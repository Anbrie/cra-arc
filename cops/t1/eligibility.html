	<h2 class="h4">What's new</h2>
	<p>For the 2020 tax year, prior to filing your tax return electronically with NETFILE, you will be asked to enter an Access code after your name, date of birth, and social insurance number. Your eight-character <strong>Access code</strong> is made up of numbers and letters and is located on the <strong>right</strong> side of your Notice of Assessment for a previous tax year. While this Access code is not mandatory, if you do not enter your Access code, you will not be able to use any information from your 2020 tax return when confirming your identity with the Canada Revenue Agency. You will have to rely on other information for authentication purposes. This code does not apply to you if you are filing your tax return for the first time.</p>

        <p>NETFILE is available to most taxpayers. However some types of tax returns can’t be sent electronically. For a list of exceptions, see “Restrictions” and “Other restrictions” below<strong>.</strong><br>
Tax preparation service providers can’t use NETFILE to file tax returns for their clients. They have to use <a href="https://canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-businesses/efile-electronic-filers.html" title="EFILE for Electronic Filers">EFILE</a>.</p>

<li>a return for any taxation year other than 2017, 2018, 2019 or 2020</li>
