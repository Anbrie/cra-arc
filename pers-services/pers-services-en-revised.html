<p>If you're an individual operating a single-person small business, such as a consultant or a contract 
	worker, and you register as a corporation, it's important that you're aware of the tax implications of 
	incorporating. You may be considered an incorporated employee, which means your obligations may 
	be different from other corporations.</p>
-->
<p>If you're running a single-person small business and you register yourself as a corporation, your tax obligations may change.</p>
<p>As an incorporated individual, the CRA may consider you to be operating a personal services business.</p>
<p>Personal services businesses are not entitled to the same tax deductions, tax rates, and eligible expenses, as other corporations.</p>

<h3>Personal Services Business</h3>
<p>If you're running a single-person small business you're considered an incorporated employee operating a personal services business if you:</p>
<ul>
  <li>are registered as a corporation</li>
  <li>are the only shareholder and the only employee of your corporation</li>
  <li>are hired by another business to perform services on behalf of the corporation </li>
  <li>perform services that would normally be performed by an employee of the business that hired you</li>
  <li>use equipment and/or tools provided by that business to perform those services</li>
  <li>only perform services for <strong>1</strong> client at a time</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="taxregs">Income Tax Act regulations</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/i-3.3/section-125.html">Income Tax Act</a> outlines the four conditions that must be met to be considered a personal services business:</p>
<ol>
	<li>The income of the corporation is from the services performed by an incorporated employee on half of the corporation</li>
	<li>The incorporated employee who is performing the services, or any person related to the incorporated employee, is a specified shareholder in the corporation</li>
	<li>If the corporation did not exist, the incorporated employee would be considered an employee of the business receiving the services</li>
	<li>The corporation does not employ more than 5 full-time employees in the business throughout the year</li>
</ol>

<h4>Why you might become an incorporated individual</h4>
<p>Businesses hire individuals to fulfill short or long-term needs. In some industries,
such as (BLANK, BLANK, and BLANK) the hiring business may require you to register as a corporation.
</p>

<p>In the case, your relationship with the hiring business is perceived as an employee/employer relationship, meaning you're considered an incorporated
employee (personal services business) rather than a self-employed individual. 
</p>

<h4> Examples - personal services business </h4>
<details>
  <summary>Example 1:</summary>
  <p>John is looking for a job. An Ontario-based trucking company (ABC Trucking) offers him a 12-month
     contract position with full-time hours. The contract comes with the stipulation that John performs his
	 services through a corporation.
  </p>
  <p>John registers as a corporation (858689 Ontario Inc.), of which he is the only shareholder and 
	 only employee. 858689 Ontario Inc.'s only client is ABC Trucking.
  </p>
  <p>858689 Ontario Inc. bills ABC Trucking for the services it performs, and it receives payment from
	 ABC Trucking for those services. 858689 Ontario Inc. either keeps the funds in the corporation or disburses them to John.
  </p>
  <p>In this example, 858689 Ontario Inc. meets the four conditions outlined in the Income Tax Act
	 to be considered a personal services business: 
  </p>
  <ol>
	<li>858689  Ontario Inc.'s income is from services performed by John (incorporated employee) for ABC Trucking</li>
	<li>John is a specified shareholder of 858689 Ontario Inc.</li>
	<li>John is the only employee of 858689 Ontario Inc.</li>
	<li>John performs the work of an ABC Trucking employee using their trucks, and would therefore be considered an employee of ABC Trucking had he not incorporated as 858689 Ontario Inc.</li>
  </ol>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Example 2:</summary>
  <p>Helen is an accountant and operates her own accounting business. She registered as a corporation (Helen Oscar Accounting Ltd.),
	 and is the only shareholder and the only employee. She recently finished a 12-month contract with ABC Cars, a major car dealer in town,
	 working in-house as their accountant. She now has another 12-month contract, this time with the 123 Cars. However,
	 she only works from their main office a couple of days a week.
  </p>
  <p>In this example, Helen Oscar Accounting Ltd. meets the four conditions outlined in the Income Tax Act
	 to be considered a personal services business:
  </p>
  <ol>
	<li>Helen Oscar Accounting Ltd.'s income is from services performed by Helen (incorporated employee) for 1 company at a time. </li>
	<li> Helen is a specified shareholder of Helen Oscar Accounting Ltd.</li>
	<li>Helen is the only employee of Helen Oscar Accounting Ltd. </li>
	<li> Helen performs the work of an employee using their equipment, office and supplies, and would therefore be considered
		 an employee of the individual car dealerships had she not incorporated as Helen Oscar Accounting Ltd.
	</li>
  </ol>
</details>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="">Self-employed individual</h3>
<p>Unlike a personal services business, a self-employed individual is <strong>not</strong> incorporated.
</p>
<p>A self-employed individual is usually considered a sole proprietor or independent contractor and performs services for several clients at the same time.
</p>
<h4> Example - self-employed individual</h3>
<details>
  <summary>Example</summary>
  <p>Jane removes snow from private properties during the winter. She operates her own business,
	 which is not incorporated, and has several clients throughout the city. She can work when she wants,
	 as long as her clients' needs are taken care of
  </p>
  <p>In this example, Jane is a self-employed individual (specially, a sole proprietor). She is not incorporated,
	 performs services for several clients at the same time, and does not meet the conditions outlined in the 
	 Income Tax Act to be considered a personal services business.
  </p>

<div>
<h2 id="deduct">Tax deductions, tax rates, and eligible expenses for a personal services business</h2>
<p>If you're an incorporated individual and considered a personal services business by the CRA, 
your tax obligations are different from other corporations
</p>
<h3>Tax deductions and tax rates</h3>
<p>A personal services business is subject to the <strong>full</strong> federal and provincial corporate tax rates on all taxable income, plus an additional 5%</a> 
on all taxable income, plus an additional 5%
</p>
<p>Unlike other corporations, a personal services business is <strong>not eligible</strong> for the:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/t4012/t2-corporation-income-tax-guide-chapter-5-page-5-t2-return.html#P2969_218288">general tax reduction</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/t4012/t2-corporation-income-tax-guide-chapter-4-page-4-t2-return.html#P2862_208254">small business deduction</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Eligible expenses</h3>
<p>A personal services business <strong>can only deduct</strong> the following expenses
</p>
<ul>
	<li>any salary, wages, benefit, or allowance the corporation pays to its incorporated employee(s)</li>
	<li>legal expenses the corporation incurs for collecting amounts owing</li>
</ul>
<h3> Ineligible expenses </h3>
<p>A personal services business <strong>cannot deduct</strong> most standard businesses expenses,
including, but not limited to:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>office supplies</li>
	<li>travel expenses</li>
	<li>meals</li>
	<li>cell phone costs</li>
</ul>


</div>
<div>
<h2 id="filing">Filing and payment obligations</h2>
<p>A personal services business is required to file a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t2.html">T2 Corporation Income Tax Return</a> and pay
any amounts owing to the CRA by the corporate tax filing and payment deadlines, like other corporations.
</p>
<p>When completing the T2 return, however, it is important to remember that a personal services business
   is <strong>not eligible</strong> to claim the same tax deductions and expenses that are available to
   other corporations, and they are subject to a higher tax rate.
</p>

<p>For details on how to complete the T2 return, refer to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/t4012.html">Guide T2012, T2 Corporation, Income Tax Guide 2019</a>.
</p>
<p>A personal services business is also responsible for their corporation's GST/HST withholding, filing, and remitting obligations</a>, as well as issuing T4 slips for any employees of their corporation.
</p>

</a></p>

<h3>Correcting tax returns</h3>
<p>If you believe you may be a personal services business and would like to correct your tax return(s)
   you previously filed, you can contact the CRA's <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/news/2017/12/backgrounder_-_voluntarydisclosuresprogram.html">Voluntary Disclosure Program</a> to determine
   if you meet the eligibility  requirements and submit an application.
