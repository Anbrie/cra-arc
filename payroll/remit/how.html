<p>If you are a client of the Workers' Compensation Board (WCB) of Nova Scotia, you can also use TeleReply to tell the Board that you have no WCB remittance to make.</p>
<p>Learn more on TeleReply for non-resident accounts: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/payroll/remitting-source-deductions/non-resident-telereply.html">Non-Resident TeleReply</a></p>
<h4>Who cannot use TeleReply</h4>

<li>you need to change your legal name or address </li>
<li>you have changed your business status </li>
<li>you are calling from outside Canada </li>
<li>you need to change a previous reply </li>
</ul>

<h4>Before you call TeleReply</h4>
<p>Have the following information available before you call TeleReply:</p>

<ul>
<li>your payroll program (RP) account number </li>
<li>the reason you are reporting a nil remittance </li>
<li>the date when you expect to next make source deductions </li>
</ul>
<p>For best results, and to ensure your privacy, do not use a cordless or cellular telephone or one with the keypad in the handset. If at any time during the call, the automated system says you cannot use TeleReply, you will need to report your nil remittance online or by mail.</p>
<h4>Hours of operation</h4>
<p>You can use TeleReply every day from 6:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m. Eastern time.</p>
<h4>How to use TeleReply</h4>
<p>To use TeleReply, simply call <strong>1-800-959-2256</strong>, and follow the instructions. At the end of the call, you will need to confirm the information you entered, and wait for a confirmation number.</p>
<p>To report a nil remittance with TeleReply, you can do one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>give the remitting period end date when you next expect to make source deductions </li>
<li>give the remitting period end date when you did not make source deductions </li>
<li>report that you do not know when you will make source deductions next </li>
</ul>
<h4>Tips for using TeleReply</h4>

<ul>

<li>write down your TeleReply confirmation number </li>
<li>if you hang up before receiving a confirmation number or the system does not give you one, you will have to call TeleReply again or use a different method to report a nil remittance </li>
</ul>
<h4>What if I made a mistake while using TeleReply</h4>
<p>If you made a mistake while using TeleReply and you have <strong>not </strong>yet received a confirmation number, you can hang up and call TeleReply again, or use another method.</p>
<p>If you made a mistake while using TeleReply and <strong>have received </strong>a confirmation number, you cannot fix it using TeleReply.

<h4>After you use TeleReply</h4>
<p>Keep your TeleReply confirmation number for your records, along with any documents supporting your nil remittance.</p>

<h2 id="h-6">How to make a payment at a Canadian financial institution</h2>
<p>You must use an <strong>original </strong>paper remittance voucher to make a payment at a Canadian financial institution.</p>

<p>You must remit by the due date even if you do not have a remittance voucher. </p>

<h2 id="h-7">What happens if you remit (pay) using the wrong method</h2>
<p>Threshold 2 accelerated remitters <strong>must </strong>remit their deductions electronically or in person at their Canadian financial institution. </p>
<p>All payments that we received at least <strong>one full day </strong>before the due date will be considered as having been made at a financial institution, so no penalty will be charged.</p>
<p>Payments made <strong>on </strong>the due date but not at a financial institution can be charged a penalty of 3% of the amount due.</p>
<p>All payments made <strong>after </strong>the due date can be charged a penalty calculated at graduated rates.</p>
