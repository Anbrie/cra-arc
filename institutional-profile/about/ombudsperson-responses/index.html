        <p>The implementation of this recommendation is still in progress and will be fully implemented by the end of September 2018.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> revised its ruling letter to include a verse to inform workers and payers involved in a <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr>/<abbr title="Employment Insurance">EI</abbr> ruling of their right to request a copy of the <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr>/<abbr title="Employment Insurance">EI</abbr> ruling report and to include instructions on how to request it. The revised ruling letter was initially piloted in one region from July to September 2017.</p>
<p>The results from this pilot were inconclusive as they did not provide sufficient information on the potential impact to the program. As a result, a decision was made to conduct a second pilot in another region from October to December 2017, which found that the inclusion of the revised verse generated an increase in the number of ruling report requests.</p>
<p>Based on the findings of the second pilot, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> decided to include the revised verse in all of its decision letters, which will be implemented by September 2018.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>’s implementation plan includes updated training for all rulings officers to ensure they understand their roles and responsibilities related to the provision of ruling reports.</p>

        <p>Between October and December 2017, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> conducted an analysis on the feasibility of this recommendation.</p>
<p>As a result of that analysis, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> expects to be able to implement this recommendation by April 1, 2019. The Agency will need to take the following steps for this to happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>gather data to determine the approximate processing time as well as the amount of time taxpayer relief officers spend on complex requests;</li>
<li>review and where necessary, revise procedures on determining the complexity of requests; and</li>
<li>review and where necessary, revise correspondence templates to:<ul>
<li>advise taxpayers if their request is routine or complex;</li>
<li>provide taxpayers with an accurate estimate of the processing time for their request based on the level of its complexity; and</li>
<li>advise taxpayers when, upon further review, the level of complexity of their request has changed.</li>

        <p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> has implemented significant enhancements to its existing Appeals workload management system and is working to update its current technologies which will contribute to further improving consistency in processing times for taxpayer relief requests across Canada.</p>
<p>Although a national process related to the movement of files was implemented in 2014, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> is working to improve technologies so that it can move away from that manual process of inventory management towards a more automated process.</p>
<p>In addition to the enhancements to its management system, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> has made the following changes that have resulted in improvements to the processing of taxpayer relief requests:</p>
<ul>
<li>changes to processes and procedures to address high inventory levels;</li>
<li>development of program monitoring and quality assurance processes, to identify issues and discrepancies, promote consistency, and identify gaps and improvements;</li>
<li>introduction on April 1, 2016, of an external service standard (acknowledgement of receipt of request within 30 calendar days) with a commitment to meet this standard 85% of the time;</li>
<li>introduction on April 1, 2017, of a new service standard (processing requests and issuing a decision within 180 calendar days) with a commitment to meet this standard 85% of the time;</li>
<li>sharing of a national process map for intake centre screeners across all regions that is expected to enhance consistency among all intake centres.</li>
</ul>
<p>These improvements have allowed the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> to reduce the processing time for taxpayer relief requests from an average of 15 months in October 2013, to 12 months in January 2015. With the change to the current manual process for inventory management, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> was able to further reduce the processing time to 6 months in October 2015. In the past year, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> processed taxpayer relief requests to cancel or waive penalties and interest within 180 days of receipt, 86.8% of the time.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> has completed a comprehensive review of its business processes for the Taxpayer Relief Program intake centres and continues to work at improving efficiency and consistency across all regions.</p>
<p>A review of the business process for the Centres of Expertise is currently in the planning phase and is expected to further improve consistency as well as reduce processing times. The expected completion date for this review is March 2020.</p>
<p>An e-services project is currently underway to improve <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/rc4288.html">Form RC4288, Request for Taxpayer Relief – Cancel or Waive Penalties or Interest</a>, which will allow taxpayers to submit structured relief requests through the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>’s online portals.

        <p>In April 2019, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> implemented a standardized approach for documenting taxpayer relief decisions.&nbsp;It is expected that this will result in more consistent processing of taxpayer relief requests.</p>
<p>In September 2019, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> will launch a pilot project for the creation of a national inventory, which will increase efficiencies in workload management, reduce regional inventory variations, and ensure a fair and consistent approach to the delivery of service to taxpayers.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> has increased its focus on continuous improvement and service, and is taking the opportunity to review, clarify, and challenge the purpose of its processes. In January 2019, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> held the first national process review event on the processing of taxpayer relief requests.&nbsp;Opportunities for improvement were identified and will be implemented, thereby contributing to maintaining nation-wide consistency.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> intends to launch a pilot in one region to test the identified improvements before the end of December 2019. This will allow the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> to make any necessary modifications prior to national implementation in April 2020.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> will continue to foster a culture of continuous improvement and identify opportunities for enhancements. These ongoing improvements, which include a focus on the needs of taxpayers, are constantly being implemented and will not only maintain, but improve nation-wide consistency in processing times of taxpayer relief requests.&nbsp;As such, the review of the business process for the Centres of Expertise is truly an evergreen process that will continue to evolve moving forward.</p>
<p>The electronic <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/rc4288.html">Form RC4288, Request for Taxpayer Relief – Cancel or Waive Penalties or Interest</a>, will be completed and available to taxpayers through the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> online portals in October 2019.</p>

        <p><a id="bnft1"></a>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> partners with shelters through the Community Volunteer Income Tax Program (<abbr title="Community Volunteer Income Tax Program">CVITP</abbr>) and the Outreach Program, to ensure that homeless and housing-insecure individuals get the benefits and credits they are entitled to receive. The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> continues to recruit shelters to participate in these programs.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> shared its regional expectations for the <abbr title="Community Volunteer Income Tax Program">CVITP</abbr> and the Outreach Program with its regional staff, across Canada, in January 2018. The following were communicated as being Agency priorities moving forward:</p>
<ul>
<li>building on existing outreach to women’s shelters; and</li>
<li>increasing the awareness of benefits and credits and of the <abbr title="Community Volunteer Income Tax Program">CVITP</abbr> among homeless and women’s shelters.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> is able to report on the following achievements between April 1, 2017, and March 31, 2018:</p>
<ul>
<li>conducted 63 outreach activities to women’s shelters, connecting with more than two thousand individuals across Canada who use shelter services;</li>
<li>created a factsheet specifically tailored for women in shelters;<br><ul class="list-unstyled">
<li><strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>
<li><strong>Note:</strong> Some information highlighted in the factsheet includes:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>how to apply for the Canada child benefit (<abbr title="Canada child benefit">CCB</abbr>);</li>
<li>the importance of filing tax returns every year, regardless of income, so as not to interrupt <abbr title="Canada child benefit ">CCB</abbr> payments;</li>
<li>how the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> helps those in abusive situations to access benefit and credit payments without the involvement of their abusive partner; and</li>
<li>how to update personal information with the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>shared benefit and credit information with more than 500 individuals at Halifax Connects and at Homeless Connect in Toronto and Vancouver (September 2017 to February 2018); and</li>
<li>provided general tax-filing and benefit information to over 250 individuals through a collaborative effort by the <abbr title="Community Volunteer Income Tax Program">CVITP</abbr> and Outreach Program at the Under One Umbrella event in Sydney, NS (November 2017).<br><br><strong> Note:</strong> Several booth visitors were not only able to have their tax slips printed by outreach officers, but were also able have their tax returns prepared and filed by <abbr title="Community Volunteer Income Tax Program">CVITP</abbr> volunteers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> is in the process of developing a 3-year strategy to reach and help vulnerable Canadians, which it expects to finalize by the fall of 2018. This strategy was developed using <a href="/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/treasury-board-submissions/gender-based-analysis-plus.html">Gender Based Analysis Plus (<abbr title="Gender Based Analysis Plus">GBA+</abbr>)</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong><abbr title="Gender-based Analysis Plus">GBA+</abbr> is the process by which a policy, program, initiative, or service can be examined for its impacts on various groups of women and men.</p>
<p>The 3-year strategy includes items on the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>housing-insecure individuals (such as shelter users) as a vulnerable group; and</li>
<li>increasing targeted outreach to shelters.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result of funding announced in the 2018 Federal Budget to expand the scope of the <abbr title="Community Volunteer Income Tax Program">CVITP</abbr> and the Outreach Program, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> will increase its visibility by approaching more organizations to create partnerships which will contribute to reaching more homeless and housing-insecure Canadians nationally.</p>
<p>To that end, efforts are underway to develop a partnership with Women’s Shelters Canada, Employment and Social Development Canada and Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada, with the aim of allowing the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> to more directly, yet discretely, communicate and offer services to most shelters in Canada.</p>

        <p><a id="bnft2"></a>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> is continuing to reach out to and partner with shelters through the Community Volunteer Income Tax Program (<abbr title="Community Volunteer Income Tax Program">CVITP</abbr>) and the Outreach Program, to ensure that homeless and housing-insecure individuals get the benefits and credits they are entitled to receive. The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> continues to recruit shelter organizations to participate in these programs.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA’</abbr>s Strategy for Reaching and Supporting Vulnerable Canadians 2018-19 to 2020-21 includes housing insecure individuals (such as shelter users and homeless individuals) as one of its target demographics. The strategy aims to increase the take-up of government benefits and credits by vulnerable individuals through enhancing awareness of benefits and credits and increasing access to free tax preparation services provided by the <abbr title="Community Volunteer Income Tax Program">CVITP</abbr> among each of its target demographics. A Gender Based Analysis Plus (<abbr title="Gender Based Analysis Plus">GBA+</abbr>) was completed during the development of the strategy.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> is preparing its regional expectations for 2019-2020, which will include outreach to shelters as a key area of focus.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> is able to report that between April 1, 2018, and March 31, 2019, it conducted 139 outreach activities to shelters and organizations that serve them, connecting with more than 3,100 individuals across Canada who use and support shelter services. Of these activities, 78 were with women's shelters and organizations that serve them, and these activities reached over 1,500 participants.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> now offers additional products tailored to women in shelters. In addition to the factsheet developed in 2017-2018, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> developed an information poster designed for women's shelters.</p>
<p>A PowerPoint presentation covering key topics of interest for shelter users was also developed to facilitate outreach to this demographic. It includes information on the Canada child benefit and the child disability benefit, the Disability Tax Credit, the <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax Credit">GST</abbr>/<abbr title="Harmonized sales tax">HST</abbr> credit, and the Working Income Tax Benefit (renamed the Canada Workers Benefit beginning with the 2019 tax year) as well as the <abbr title="Community Volunteer Income Tax Program">CVITP</abbr>.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> established an outreach partnership with Women’s Shelters Canada to promote benefit and credit awareness and the free tax filing services provided by the <abbr title="Community Volunteer Income Tax Program">CVITP</abbr> among its membership. Women’s Shelters Canada is a network of 14 provincial and territorial shelter networks representing over 400 shelters across Canada. It works as a unified voice to collaborate, educate, and innovate for systemic change that ends violence against women. Through the partnership, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> was able to include an article titled &quot;Getting Benefits when They’re Needed the Most&quot; in Women’s Shelters Canada’s Fall 2018 quarterly newsletter.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> is also working with the developer of Women In Safe Housing (<abbr title="Women In Safe Housing">WISH</abbr>) software, which is used by shelters across the country for client intake and reporting purposes. Through this partnership, the software was updated to include links on benefits and credits and free tax help. This helps shelter staff provide this information more consistently to their clients as details are readily available on their screens. The next <abbr title="Women In Safe Housing">WISH</abbr> software update will include a link to the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA’</abbr>s Child and Family Benefits Calculator, to expand the information readily available to shelter staff and users.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> participates in numerous outreach activities across the country to provide services to&nbsp; homeless and housing-insecure individuals, and the organizations that serve them such as, the Homeless Connex events. It also participated in the Shelters of the Future conference in June 2018, hosted by Women’s Shelters Canada. The conference was attended by over 600 individuals, and allowed <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> officers to connect with shelter organizations from across the country and other related provincial/territorial organizations.</p>

<p id="bnft3">The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>’s Strategy for Reaching and Supporting Vulnerable Canadians 2018-19 to 2020-21 seeks to improve access to free tax preparation services provided by the Community Volunteer Income Tax Program (CVITP) and to heighten awareness of benefits and credits, thereby increasing their take-up by vulnerable individuals among target population groups, including housing insecure individuals such as shelter users and those experiencing homelessness.</p>

<p>To ensure that these individuals have access to the benefits and credits to which they are entitled, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> continues to recruit the participation of shelter organizations through both the <abbr title="Community Volunteer Income Tax Program">CVITP</abbr> and the Benefits Outreach Program.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> is pleased to report that between April 1, 2019, and March 31, 2020, it conducted 128 outreach activities to shelters and organizations that serve them, connecting with more than 1,380 individuals across Canada who use and support shelter services. Of these activities, 64 were with women’s shelters and organizations that serve them, reaching over 470 participants.</p>

<p>In addition, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> organizes numerous outreach activities across the country to provide services to homeless and housing-insecure individuals and the organizations that serve them. Between April 1, 2019, and March 31, 2020, it conducted 164 such activities connecting with more than 3,000 individuals across Canada who use and support services for homeless and housing-insecure people.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> continues to participate in many large events across the country that provide services to homeless and housing-insecure individuals. Last year, <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> outreach officers participated in the following events which were done in partnership with CVITP volunteers who completed tax returns on-site for interested attendees:</p>
<ul>
<li>Under One Umbrella in Sydney, <abbr title="Nova Scotial">NS</abbr><br>
(150 visitors to its booth).</li>

<li>Homeless Connect in Toronto, <abbr title="Ontario">ON</abbr><br>
(130 visitors to its booth).</li>

<li>Homeless Connect in Fort McMurray, <abbr title="Alberta">AB</abbr><br> (120 visitors to its booth).</li>

<li>End Homelessness in Winnipeg, <abbr title="Manitoba">MB</abbr><br> 
(120 visitors to its booth).</li>

<li>Whitehorse Connects through partnership with Yukon Anti-Poverty Coalition<br>
(21 visitors to its booth).</li>
</ul>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> has also developed a group of products designed specifically for women in shelters. This includes a factsheet, a poster, a promo card, and a webinar that speaks directly to the needs of this group of individuals. The goal of these products is to provide the information necessary for women in shelters to gain access to benefits and credits that they may not be aware of, and to continue receiving those that they had been getting prior to moving to the shelter. Based on feedback from field officers, some of the products have since also been translated into various foreign and Indigenous languages.</p>

<p>In response to <abbr title="Coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr> mitigations and the barriers caused by physical distancing measures, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> introduced Virtual Clinics. This mechanism established the parameters by which volunteers are able to continue to assist vulnerable individuals in filing their Income Tax and Benefit returns through virtual means, by drop-off, video-conferencing, and telephone clinic sessions. </p>

<p>As part of this initiative, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> worked with organizations hosting virtual clinics to authenticate and confirm the identification of tax filers. This included those who were homeless or housing insecure. Once their return is filed, tax filers may access the benefits and credits designed to support them. Also through this process, clients are informed when they have uncashed federal cheques and are referred to My Account or the General Enquiries line for further details.</p>

<p>To support the introduction of Virtual Clinics, and as a unique response to the <abbr title="Coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr> pandemic, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> has also developed an additional temporary service for taxpayers, the Individual Tax Filing Assistance Initiative.</p> 

<p>As of July 27, 2020, <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> will be calling taxpayers who have not filed their 2019 tax return, and who would be eligible for the <abbr title="Community Volunteer Income Tax Program">CVITP</abbr> service. The goal is to encourage these individuals to file their return in order to receive all benefits and credits to which they may be entitled.</p> 

<p>The officers will be able to direct the taxpayers to still-active virtual tax clinics, online certified tax software (some of which are free), and services offered via a toll free number to help file their return. In certain circumstances, officers will also be able to complete tax returns directly with the taxpayer over the phone.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Community Volunteer Income Tax Program">CVITP</abbr> and Benefits Outreach programs continue to target and focus its efforts on a variety of vulnerable populations and groups, including those who use shelters, and the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> will continue to monitor, review, and report on their on-going efforts.</p>

<p>Through the various changes implemented as well as the ongoing efforts of the <abbr title="Community Volunteer Income Tax Program">CVITP</abbr> and Benefits Outreach Program since the publishing of this report, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> has addressed this recommendation in full.</p>

<div class="alert alert-info">
<p>The Taxpayers’ Ombudsman recommends the Canada Revenue Agency change the validity period of the legal warning back to 180 days, from 365&nbsp;days.</p>
</div>
<h4><abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>’s response</h4>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> agrees to conduct a study to determine the best course of action to address this recommendation.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> is not sure that a change in the validity period from 365 to 180 days would have an impact on whether a taxpayer remembers the consequences of non-payment. As a result, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> commits to first examining the implications of this recommendation. This will assist in the decision-making process of whether to change the validity period from the current policy of 365 days to 180 days or another reasonable timeframe.</p>
<p>This first step in addressing this recommendation will be completed by the end of December 2019.</p>

<summary>Recommendation #2</summary>
<section class="alert alert-info">
<p>The Taxpayers’ Ombudsman recommends the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) update its legal warning policies to ensure the following information is provided to taxpayers when a legal warning is given:</p>
<ol>
<li>An explanation of the meaning of the legal warning;</li>
<li>The validity period of the legal warning;</li>
<li>The consequences of non-payment; and</li>
<li>What legal actions can be taken by the CRA.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<h4><abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>’s response</h4>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> agrees with the recommendation. Although the report highlights the fact that legal warning is currently embedded in the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>’s operations, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> recognizes there are opportunities to refine its policies and explanatory material for even greater clarity.</p>
<p>A fulsome review of the collections content on Canada.ca is already underway as a result of usability testing conducted with taxpayers in the Spring of 2018. This review will result in an updated architecture for the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>’s website as well as a comprehensive review of content, making it easier for taxpayers to find information that is clear and consistent.</p>
<p>In addition, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> commits to the following actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>providing an explanation of the meaning of “legal warning” and ensure that it appears on its website;</li>
<li>ensuring that the validity period is provided to taxpayers who are dealing with employees responsible for the collection of debts;<br><strong>Note:&nbsp; </strong>Although there is no legislative requirement for the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> to have a validity period, it put one in place to ensure that there was consistency among the employees responsible for the collection of debts when dealing with taxpayers.</li>
<li>reviewing its external publications related to Collections (web content on Canada.ca, information to taxpayers, etc.) in collaboration with communication advisors who will help to develop messaging and products that are clear, easily interpreted as well as consistent in the terminology used throughout the various channels.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although information on the consequences of non-payment and the legal actions that can be taken by the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> is currently available on its external website, this information will also be looked at as part of this global initiative.</p>
<p>Given the scope of this commitment and the consultations required, this initiative is expected to be completed by December 2019.</p>

<div class="alert alert-info">
<p>The Taxpayers’ Ombudsman recommends the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) update its internal and external messaging to ensure all debt payment and collections related terminology is clearly and consistently defined and used; and information communicated and available to taxpayers is clear, in plain language, complete, and consistent. External messaging includes, but is not limited to, information relayed using: the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> website, correspondence sent to taxpayers, and procedures/scripts used to inform and direct taxpayers (for example, the Debt Management Call Centre Manual, the National Collections Manual, and the Individual Services Technical Help Guide (ISTHG), etc.).
</p>

<h4><abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>’s response</h4>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> agrees with the recommendation and is taking action to refine these information products.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> has already began the process of updating its internal manuals in the Collections program by taking the following actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>updating the legal warning scripts in the Debt Management Call Centre (<abbr title="Debt Management Call Centre">DMCC</abbr>) manuals by removing the phrase “legal measures” for consistency;</li>
<li>changing its Tax Services Office (<abbr title="Tax Services Office">TSO</abbr>) and National Verification and Collections Centre (<abbr title="National Verification and Collections Centre">NVCC</abbr>) letters in <span class="nowrap">January 2018</span> to include the following:<br><blockquote>If you fail to pay your account or respond to this letter within 14 days, we may take legal action against you.

<summary>Recommendation #5</summary>
<section class="alert alert-info">
<p>The Taxpayers’ Ombudsman recommends the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) ensure sufficient training is provided and knowledge is transferred to:</p>
<ol>
<li>All CRA employees who may be involved in the collection process so they are able to accurately speak with a taxpayer about the taxpayer’s debt and their particular circumstances;</li>
<li>All CRA employees who provide legal warnings, so they are able to provide an explanation of the legal warning, the validity period of the legal warning, the consequences of non-payment of debts with the CRA, including legal actions that can be taken by the CRA; and</li>
<li>All CRA employees who may be contacted by taxpayers about collection matters (including agents at the individual tax enquiries line) so they are able to provide information to taxpayers about the consequences of non-payment of debts with the CRA, including legal actions that can be taken by the CRA.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<h4><abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>’s response</h4>
<p>The Agency agrees with the recommendation.</p>
<p>Although the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> believes that the training currently provided to the <strong>agents involved in the collection process</strong> as well as those who provide legal warnings to taxpayers is sufficiently robust, it does commit to reviewing its training products to identify if opportunities exist to bolster these messages. The goal being to ensure that the employees who are directly involved in the collection process understand the responsibilities as well as consequences of non-compliance at each level of the <abbr title="Debt Management Call Centre">DMCC</abbr>, the <abbr title="National Verification and Collections Centre">NVCC</abbr>, and the <abbr title="Tax Services Office">TSO</abbr>.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> feels that the training currently provided to <strong>non-collection agents</strong> such as agents on the individual income tax enquiries (<abbr title="Individual income tax enquiries">IITE</abbr>) line and auditors, is sufficient. Non-collection agents do not provide legal warning and should not provide any of this information. While non-collection agents can suggest to taxpayers that they can make arrangements to pay their debt, they should refer taxpayers to the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> website or to the Information Circular for more information on legal warning and the consequences of non-payment.</p>
<p>Based on a discussion between the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> and the Office of the Taxpayers’ Ombudsman (<abbr title="Office of the Taxpayers’ Ombudsman">OTO</abbr>), the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> is of the understanding that the intention of #3 under Recommendation #5 was to ensure that <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> employees outside of the collection process, who may be contacted by taxpayers about collection matters, have sufficient training to direct taxpayers to the Collections program, its available resources, or to answer general questions. It is further the understanding of the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> that this recommendation refers only to general information about consequences of non-payment and not to consequences related to specific individual accounts</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> has already taken steps to reinforce with non-collection agents such as auditors that they are to direct taxpayers to the Collections Division and/or to the Collections content on Canada.ca. Audit procedures were updated accordingly in September 2017.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> will review messaging to other non-collection agents, such as <abbr title="Individual income tax enquiries">IITE</abbr> agents, to ensure that they provide sufficient information to taxpayers and direct those requiring more information to the Collections program.</p>
<p>Given the scope of this commitment and the consultations with other program areas within the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> that will be necessary, this initiative is expected to be completed by December 2019.</p>

<section class="alert alert-info">
<p>In the course of reviewing its processes, policies and information regarding payment arrangements, the Taxpayers’ Ombudsman recommends the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) consider:</p>
<ol>
<li>Making information available to taxpayers on the parameters and other requirements for a binding payment arrangement;</li>
<li>The need for clarity and consistency in its terminology and definitions;</li>
<li>The need for clarity and consistency in its processes; and</li>
<li>Making information available to taxpayers to explain the differences in the types of arrangements for payment, which are not binding payment arrangements, the consequences for non-payment in each situation, and which CRA agents can make binding payment arrangements.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<h4><abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>’s response</h4>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> agrees with the recommendation.</p>
<p>As indicated in the&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>’s response to Recommendations #2 and #4, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> is committed to completing a global review of its external products related to Collections and has already begun the process of updating its internal manuals in the Collections program.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> encourages the voluntary compliance of taxpayers who pay off their debts. This includes taxpayers who voluntarily set up payment arrangements without involving a <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> agent involved in the collection process. The review of information related to payment arrangements, regardless of whether it is voluntary or with a <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> agent involved in the collection process will be part of the global review as described in the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA’</abbr>s response to Recommendation #2.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> requests that any outstanding debt be paid in full by taxpayers. Should the taxpayer be unable to pay the debt in full, payment arrangements may be considered. General parameters related to payment arrangements can be made available to taxpayers; however, a collector has some discretion as each collection case is judged on its own merit.</p>
<p>Given the scope of these combined commitments and the consultations required, this initiative is expected to be completed by December 2019.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> agrees that this recommendation has merit, and will conduct a review to better evaluate the most appropriate and beneficial approach.</p>
<p>As noted in the report, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> currently provides a payment arrangement confirmation letter to taxpayers upon request. It is the understanding of the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> that not all taxpayers or their representatives want a confirmation letter. Therefore, before determining whether a letter should be sent to all taxpayers or representatives who make a payment arrangement, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> will undertake to further review this option to better understand taxpayers’ preference and will conduct a cost/benefit analysis of this proposal. The review will be completed by <span class="nowrap">December 2019</span>.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> will update its current procedures to allow for an active offer of service. This means that the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> will give taxpayers the option of whether they would like a payment arrangement confirmation letter or not at the time that the arrangement is made. This change will be implemented by the end of <span class="nowrap">March 2019</span>.</p>

        <h3>Overarching responses</h3>
<h4><a id="rsp1"></a>#1</h4>
<h4>Service standards theme</h4>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> is responsible for the administration of the Income Tax Act (<abbr title="Income Tax Act">ITA</abbr>) and related legislation, as well as benefit and tax credit programs on behalf of the federal, provincial, territorial, and First Nations governments. Over 29 million tax returns are received each year, with 25 million filed between <span class="nowrap">mid-February </span>and April 30th. The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> strives to process all of these returns in an efficient manner and has made significant improvements over the last several years. For example, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> met the service standard over 97% of the time (97.2% for digital returns and 97.4% for paper returns).</p>
<p>Service standards publicly state the level of performance that citizens can reasonably expect to encounter from the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> under normal circumstances. The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> sets targets for achieving each service standard based on operational realities, infrastructure, available resources, historical performance, degree of complexity of the work, and expectations of Canadians.</p>
<p>While the majority of returns are processed within standard, there are exceptions that occur during the short timeframe of the filing season. For example, returns that have inaccurate or missing information can naturally result in delays. The <abbr title="Income Tax Act">ITA</abbr> is complex and occasionally necessitates longer manual processing for some types of tax returns. Small volumes of each situation means the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>'s system cannot be <span class="nowrap">cost-effectively</span> programmed to assess these returns without creating an unacceptable risk to the system's integrity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>'s mandate includes ensuring that Canada's self-assessment tax system is sustained. The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>'s review activities promote awareness of and compliance with the laws it administers and plays an important role in maintaining the integrity of, and the Canadian public's confidence in the tax system. To this end, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> continues to audit, verify and match during the filing period which results in a small percentage of returns taking longer to finalize.</p>
<p>Despite these realities, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>'s efforts to improve service as mentioned above have facilitated annual changes to the returns processing standards allowing more transparency and clarity for both citizens and non-residents. This process is ongoing, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> regularly revises its service standards to make sure that they are up-to-date and relevant.</p>
<h4><a id="rsp2"></a># 2</h4>
<h4>Timeliness of processing theme</h4>
<p>Historical results illustrate that the vast majority of files are processed within the timeframes identified in the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>'s service standards. Given the short period of the filing season, combined with operational realities such as infrastructure, available resources, and the complexity of the ITA, the service standards represent a level of performance that the majority of citizens can rely upon.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> acknowledges that it experienced some transitional difficulties with the introduction of the first major phase of its technological renewal in February 2016, resulting in higher than normal inventories. In November 2016, Service Renewal consolidated the workload from seven to three Tax Centres (<abbr title="Tax Centres">TCs</abbr>) which required the TCs to hire and train large numbers of new employees. The resulting learning curve and impact on productivity took some time to diminish. These changes were necessary to modernize both the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>'s systems and operations and the past filing season saw substantial improvements in processing timeframes.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> is committed to being a fair, helpful, and responsive tax administration with a client-centric focus. Its commitment to service excellence in this regard has resulted in a number of filing improvements over the last few years. This includes sharing data on information slips via the AutoFill my Return service, simplifying the completion of returns on behalf of certain fixed-income Canadians, real-time tax return processing, improved ability to track files through each stage, more up-front validation of reported income, and immediate availability of notices of assessment. Many of these initiatives have stemmed from both increases in digital filing and a major technological investment that will see the complete redesign of the returns processing foundation.</p>
<p>Technological improvements are ongoing and the renewal of the processing framework for individual returns will be completed in 2020. Utilizing this foundation, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> will be continuing the modernization of its service offerings such as increasing the types of tax returns that can be electronically filed, decreasing the volume of returns that necessitate human intervention, and vastly improving processing times for those returns that require manual (re)assessments.</p>
<h4><a id="rsp3"></a># 3</h4>
<h4>Exception processing theme</h4>
<p>As indicated by the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>'s year-over-year results, the majority of tax returns and reassessments are processed expeditiously. Small volumes do need to be diverted from the normal flow due to errors, omissions, validation activities, or technical complexities. The timeframes involved in each type of situation are very difficult to accurately predict since there are many variables including the time needed for taxpayers to correct information or provide documentation, as well as the effort required by various areas within the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> that must utilize specific expertise, to finalize complex files.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> is making improvements to assist taxpayers in better understanding the time needed to complete their files. The first step is to improve the information available on the Canada.ca website by implementing a tool that will provide taxpayers with general processing times for a range of <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> services and an indication of when they might be able to expect a response. In addition, a progress tracker for account specific enquiries will be available in the secure portals beginning in May 2021, that will let taxpayers or their representative know when a file was received, as well as its status during the processing cycle. This same information is already available to call centre agents and is communicated to taxpayers when requested.</p>

        <h4><abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA’</abbr>s response</h4>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> is in agreement with the overall recommendation to continue to remove barriers to the use of the <abbr title="Community Volunteer Income Tax Program">CVITP</abbr>.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> recognizes the importance of the <abbr title="Community Volunteer Income Tax Program">CVITP</abbr> and has taken many steps to reduce and/or remove barriers to those wanting to access the program.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of walk-in and mobile clinics increased by 600 (95.5%) between the 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 fiscal years. Increased take up is expected to continue beyond 2020.</li>
<li>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> has expanded the online services available to volunteers and organizations with the addition of the Auto-Fill My Return (AFR) feature, and will continue to explore opportunities to support more online services where appropriate in the future.</li>
<li>New partnerships have been developed with professional associations and community organizations, resulting in continued growth of the program.</li>
</ul>
<p>A key consideration when exploring the feasibility of expanding services is the protection of client information.&nbsp; <abbr title="Community Volunteer Income Tax Program">CVITP</abbr> volunteers do not have the ability to access taxpayer information via <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> systems in order to validate the taxpayer’s identify.&nbsp; As a result, it is not possible for volunteers to provide assistance by phone.&nbsp; The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> is not prepared to change its position in this regard and will not pursue this aspect of the recommendation further.</p>
<p>The following actions have been taken or are underway and will be in place by December 2020, in advance of the next tax filing season:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updating training modules for <abbr title="Community Volunteer Income Tax Program">CVITP</abbr> volunteers. Existing training modules will be refreshed and new modules created to provide additional information on the following topics:<ul>
<li>The need for EFILE returns to be transmitted within 48 hours;</li>
<li>Targeted situations such as the handling of tax exempt income for Indigenous peoples and;</li>
<li>Information on the <abbr title="Community Volunteer Income Tax Program">CVITP</abbr> program overall.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An increase in program-dedicated staff in both Headquarters and the regions.<ul>
<li>This expansion includes additional &quot;year-round&quot; tax clinics and more outreach activities to vulnerable population segments including Indigenous peoples, newcomers and refugees, seniors, youth, persons with disabilities, modest income Canadians, and homeless and housing insecure individuals.</li>
<li>Increased <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> support in the solicitation of volunteers, to allow organizations and clinics to, at their discretion, provide year-round, tailored and ongoing support to and training of partner organizations and volunteers to enable the filing of returns.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Improved training for phone agents responding to calls on the dedicated <abbr title="Community Volunteer Income Tax Program">CVITP</abbr> line to ensure that &quot;exception type&quot; situations are appropriately addressed.</li>

<p>The <abbr title="Community Volunteer Income Tax Program">CVITP</abbr> has been designed as a partnership with community organizations and their volunteers.

<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> has improved training material on existing tax scenarios which include different types of income and has added new tax scenarios for the 2020 Filing Season. The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> plans to consult with partner organizations and volunteers after the filing season to obtain feedback and identify any gaps.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Community Volunteer Income Tax Program">CVITP</abbr> provides organizations with recommended guidelines to assist taxpayers with modest incomes and simple tax situations, but the program does not limit the types of returns that can be filed, this is left to the discretion of the volunteers.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> confirms that the thresholds are suggested income levels only and the organizations can increase them at their discretion. The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> recognizes however, that in some cases, increasing the thresholds could have an adverse impact on the clinic's capacity to serve those most in need.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> will provide increased support in the solicitation of volunteers to allow organizations and clinics to, at their discretion, adjust the accepted income thresholds which will allow clinics to assist even more Canadians in filing their taxes.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Community Volunteer Income Tax Program">CVITP</abbr> will explore opportunities to increase awareness of the review and verification process and will investigate the support needed to enable clinics to assist clients under review by December 2020.</p>
<p>As a result of increased funding, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> will continue to expand the program, thereby helping thousands more individuals complete their taxes and access benefits to which they are entitled. This will be accomplished through an increase in program-dedicated staff in both Headquarters and the regions. This expansion includes additional &quot;year-round&quot; tax clinics and more outreach activities to vulnerable population segments including Indigenous peoples, newcomers and refugees, seniors, youth, persons with disabilities, modest income Canadians, and homeless and housing insecure individuals.</p>

<li>Developed business intelligence tools to provide information on where to target efforts to increase <abbr title="Community Volunteer Income Tax Program">CVITP</abbr> coverage in geographical areas where there are gaps in service to segments of the population, such as a tool which allows users to target grouped taxpayers by:<ul>
<li>Income types such as, employment income, old age security, pension income, social assistance, and workers compensation;</li>
<li>Grouped levels of income;</li>
<li>Number of benefit recipients.</li>

<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> agrees with this recommendation.</p>
<p>In February 2019, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> opened three northern service centres in Whitehorse, Yellowknife, and Iqaluit to provide increased tax support to individuals and businesses throughout the territories year-round. This was in response to feedback received through the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>’s Serving You Better consultations and as a result of recent research on barriers to tax filing. <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> employees in these centres are working to increase the awareness of benefits and credits among territorial residents, expand the <abbr title="Community Volunteer Income Tax Program">CVITP</abbr>, and help businesses meet their tax obligations.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> has recently restructured functional operations to place an increased focus on national partnerships and increased regional resources to ensure that organizations receive support to offer year-round tax clinics. Building new national partnerships, will contribute to the recruitment of additional volunteers as well as organizations offering tax clinics. The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> will develop a strategy to articulate these steps by September 2020. In addition, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> is committed to increasing volunteer retention and recruitment by utilizing business intelligence to identify areas of greatest need, where gaps exist in terms of eligible tax filers, and where there is a requirement for additional tax clinics.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> will explore the feasibility of seeking financial authorities to pursue grants and contributions that could further help organizations in their retention and recruitment of volunteers.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> has also improved outreach and <abbr title="Community Volunteer Income Tax Program">CVITP</abbr> products by developing products in a number of third languages, updating products and new materials to demystify the <abbr title="Community Volunteer Income Tax Program">CVITP</abbr> for potential volunteers, and organizations to draw more people into the program.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>’s Code of Integrity and Professional Conduct (Code) does not establish rules for employees to follow, but rather reflects rules, legislation, and specific expectations that have been established elsewhere in the Agency.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> is nearing the completion of a scheduled 5 year comprehensive review of the Code. One of the proposed updates to the Code is a new reference to the <abbr title="Taxpayer Bill of Rights">TBR</abbr> in the introduction as well as a link to the <abbr title="Taxpayer Bill of Rights">TBR</abbr> webpage.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> agrees with this recommendation in part.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> is unable to implement this recommendation to the extent suggested due to the scope of the <abbr title="Taxpayer Bill of Rights">TBR</abbr>.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Taxpayer Bill of Rights">TBR</abbr> describes the treatment a taxpayer is entitled to when they deal with the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>. The Community Volunteer Income Tax Program (<abbr title="Community Volunteer Income Tax Program">CVITP</abbr>) is a collaboration between the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> and community organizations. Community organizations host tax preparation clinics across Canada and arrange for volunteers to prepare income tax and benefit returns for eligible individuals. When a taxpayer is dealing with a <abbr title="Community Volunteer Income Tax Program">CVITP</abbr> clinic, they are not dealing directly with the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>. While the <abbr title="Community Volunteer Income Tax Program">CVITP</abbr> volunteers are not responsible for upholding the <abbr title="Taxpayer Bill of Rights">TBR</abbr>, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> does agree that it would be beneficial for them to be aware of it.</p>
<p>Therefore, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> agrees to conduct a review of the training package for <abbr title="Community Volunteer Income Tax Program">CVITP</abbr> volunteers to see where it would be feasible to include mention of the <abbr title="Taxpayer Bill of Rights">TBR</abbr>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> currently has an external webpage committed to information related to the <abbr title="Taxpayer Bill of Rights">TBR</abbr>. This page is in the process of being updated to include the information noted in this recommendation. As a result, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> has determined that it would not be efficient to create a separate internal webpage containing the same information. Any hyperlinks added to internal products and webpages will point to the external <abbr title="Taxpayer Bill of Rights">TBR</abbr> webpage.</p>
<p>As noted in the Ombudsman report, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> already makes linkages to the <abbr title="Taxpayer Bill of Rights">TBR</abbr> in several of its corporate plans and reports, and will continue to do so. In addition, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> commits to the following actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>ensuring that as internal products and webpages are going through routine updates that they are reviewed for opportunities to link to and promote the <abbr title="Taxpayer Bill of Rights">TBR</abbr>;</li>
<li>ensuring that the process for developing new internal products and webpages includes identifying opportunities to incorporate information and linkages to the <abbr title="Taxpayer Bill of Rights">TBR</abbr>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> will conduct a review of its existing internal products and webpages, where relevant, to identify opportunities to incorporate linkages to and promotion of the <abbr title="Taxpayer Bill of Rights">TBR</abbr>.</p>

<p>In addition to the mandatory performance expectations set out by the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> for its Executives (<abbr title="Executives">EXs</abbr>) that include the mandatory commitments and corporate priorities on which they are expected to deliver, <abbr title="Executives">EXs</abbr> have to list their key priorities relating to the programs, projects or services for which they are responsible along with associated performance measures that are applicable.</p>
<p>Since not all executives play a direct role in upholding the <abbr title="Taxpayer Bill of Rights">TBR</abbr> in their area of responsibility, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> does not believe that it would be appropriate to create a mandatory performance expectation related to this requirement. However, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> has decided to add the <abbr title="Taxpayer Bill of Rights">TBR</abbr> to the list of documents that <abbr title="Executives">EXs</abbr> are asked to reference as they set out their deliverables and performance measures associated with key government priorities and documents relating to their area of responsibility.</p>

        <h4><abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>’s response</h4>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> agrees with this recommendation in principle.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> agrees that promoting the <abbr title="Taxpayer Bill of Rights">TBR</abbr> and making it a more prominent fixture in its facilities would be an effective means of raising the awareness of its employees.</p>
<p>In achieving this goal and based on its experiences, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> believes that the most impactful placement for this type of information is not necessarily in public facing areas as recommended or in areas where there is a lot of transitory movement, such as entry ways, elevators, lobbies, etc. It has been noted that when information is placed in these types of areas, individuals will usually pass by without paying much attention to what is posted.</p>
<p>In addition, it is important to keep in mind that the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> currently occupies 102 buildings nationally in one capacity or another. 38% of the buildings are Crown owned while 62% are leased (either space within the building or the entire building). There is an extensive process to request permission from landlords to post information in public facing areas, without a guarantee that permission will be granted. Based on past experiences and its commitment to sustainable development, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> will explore best practices that will allow it to make the best use of&nbsp; available resources to pursue this option.</p>
<p>In addition, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> believes that a digital solution would be the most effective and efficient method of promoting the <abbr title="Taxpayer Bill of Rights">TBR</abbr>. The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> agrees to conduct an analysis of the digital options available for this purpose.</p>
<p>In the interim, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> will send an email to all of its employees which will include a copy of the <abbr title="Taxpayer Bill of Rights">TBR</abbr> poster and a link to the <abbr title="Taxpayer Bill of Rights">TBR</abbr> webpage.</p>
<p>This will complement the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>’s existing initiatives to promote the <abbr title="Taxpayer Bill of Rights">TBR</abbr> such as the annual communication on the <abbr title="Taxpayer Bill of Rights">TBR</abbr> sent by the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>’s Commissioner&nbsp; and the posting of the <abbr title="Taxpayer Bill of Rights">TBR</abbr> banner to the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>’s login screen for employees for a week’s rotation.</p>
