<h1 property="name" id="wb-cont">Taxes and benefits for Indigenous peoples</h1>
<section>

<p>As an Indigenous person, there may be some forms or processes specific to you. But in general, tax obligations are the same as any other resident in Canada.</p>

<h2>On this page:</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="#getting">Getting benefits and credits</a></li>
<li><a href="#covid">If you received COVID-related benefits</a></li>
<li><a href="#taxes">Doing your taxes</a></li>
<li><a href="#validation">If you received a validation letter</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="getting">Getting benefits and credits</h2>
		<p>There are some benefits that are only available if you file a tax return. So it’s worth doing even if you normally don’t have to</p>
		<p>For example, the following benefits are available only once having filed:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>GST/HST credit</li>
				<li>Canada Child Benefit (CCB)</li>
				<li>Disability Tax Credit</li>
				<li>Northern Residents Deduction</li>
				<li>Canada Workers Benefit</li>
			</ul>
		<p>Other benefits and credits for Indigenous peoples been collected here:</p>
		<p><a href="#">Benefits and credits: Information for Indigenous peoples</a></p>
	<h3>How personal circumstances affect access to benefits</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>If you’re married (common-law included), only one partner can access certain credits</li>
				<li>Canada Child Benefit also… other reasons</li>
			</ul>	
<h2 id="covid">If you received COVID-related benefits</h2>
		<p>If you received COVID benefits, you may be able to claim taxes back, or you may owe additional taxes.</p>
	<h3>If you received the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB)</h3>
		<p>If your regular income is tax-exempt and you received CERB, you don’t have to pay taxes on the CERB</p>
		<p>It’s the income that led to your eligibility that determines if you’re eligible</p>
		<p><a href="#">Questions and answers about what is taxable in the CERB</a></p>
		<p>If you do pay taxes on your income, you will have to pay taxes on the CERB.</p>
		<p><a href="#">Paying back CERB if necessary</a></p>
	<h3>If you received one of the recovery benefits (CRB, CRSB, CRCB)</h3>
		<p>Collecting 10% back if your income is tax-exempt. If you received one of the Canada Recovery Benefits 10% of the tax was withheld at source,</p>
		including those individuals with income that may be exempt from tax. If some or all of your income is exempt from tax under section 87 of the
		<i>Indian Act</i> and you are registered, or entitled to be registered as an Indian under that Act, you may be able to get part or all of the tax
		back for payments received in 2020 or 2021 by filing a tax return for that year. This may include filling out Form T90, Income exempt under the
		<i>Indian Act</i>, as part of the return or you may be eligible for a simple return (see the Getting Benefits and Credits section on this page)</p>
		<p>If you earned more than $38,000 (other conditions) you will have to pay (something) back [use the Q and As that are being developed to answer this]</p>
		<p>If your income is tax-exempt, you probably don’t have to pay it back.</p>
	<h3>CESB</h3>
		<p>This is fully taxable by everyone, regardless of tax-exemptions</p>
<h2 id="taxes">Doing your taxes</h2>
	<h3>Get help doing your taxes</h3>
		<p>There are tax clinics staffed by volunteers to help you through filing</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="#">Free tax clinics</a></li>
				<li><a href="#">Northern Service Centres</a></li>
				<li>Quebec has tax volunteers</li>
			</ul>	
    <h3>If you live in the north</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Line 25500 Northern residents deductions</li>
				<li>Northern Residents</li>
			</ul>	
    <h3>If you're tax-exempt</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="#">Information on the tax exemption under section 87 of the Indian Act</a></li>
				<li><a href="#">T90 Income exempt under the Indian Act</a></li>
			</ul>	
<h2 id="validation">If you received a validation letter</h2>
		<p>They're to help ensure you keep getting your benefits.</p>
		<p>We need the right information on file.</p>
<h3>Why you may have received one</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Collecting missing info</li>
				<li>Often related to children in your care</li>
				<li>Maybe about your address</li>
			</ul>	
<h3>What you can do once you’ve received one</h3>
		<p>Contact the CRA to provide that specific information</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="#">What to do if the CRA reviews your benefits</a></li>
				<li><a href="#">Benefits being reviewed? Here’s what you need to know</a></li>
				<li><a href="#">Validating your eligibility for benefits and credits</a></li>
