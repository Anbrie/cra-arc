    <li><a href="#h_3">What happens if you file late or you do not file</a></li>
   
  </ul>
 
<h2 id="h_1">What is the filing due date</h2>
<p>Generally, if you are filing:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>T4, T4A, T4A-NR and T4A-RCA </strong>slips, the filing due date is the last day of February after the reporting year </li>
<li><strong>T5018 </strong>slips, six months after the end of the reporting period chosen by the taxpayer </li>
<li><strong>T1204 </strong>slips, March 31 after the reporting year </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h_1_1">Filing due date in special situation</h3>
<details><summary>Employee stopped working for you</summary>
<p>The filing due date does not change. At the time an employee stops working for you due to layoff, retirement, resignation, or dismissal, we suggest you calculate the year to date earnings and give the employee a slip.</p>
</details>


<details><summary>Your business stops operating, or a partner or the sole proprietor dies</summary>
<p>The filing due date is:</p>

<ul>
<li>30 days from the date your business stops </li>
<li>90 days from the date a partner or the sole proprietor dies </li>
</ul>
</details>

<details><summary>Your business amalgamated</summary>
<p>The due dates for filing slips will depend on whether the predecessor's remittance balance is <strong>moved </strong>to the payroll account of the successor company.</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
  <li class="cnjnctn-col">
    <h4 class="mrgn-tp-sm text-muted h4">Balance is not moved to the successor's BN</h4>
	
       
<p>If the remittance balance is <strong>not </strong>moved to the successor's payroll account:</p>

<ul>
<li>the predecessor has to file slips for the period up to the day before the amalgamation <strong>within 30 days of the account closure</strong> </li>
<li>the successor files the slips from the amalgamation date until the end of the year by the regular due dates </li>
</ul>



  </li>
  <li class="cnjnctn-col">
    <h4 class="mrgn-tp-sm text-muted h4">Balance moved to the successor's BN</h4>
    <p>The predecessor companies do not have to file returns for the period leading up to the amalgamation and the successor company files the returns for the entire year by the regular due dates.</p>
<p>The filing of a predecessor in an employer restructuring situation also follows these rules. </p>

  </li>
</ul>
</details>


<details><summary>Information returns filed by a service bureau</summary>
<p>The filing due date does not change.  If a service bureau files a return for you, you are still responsible for the accuracy of the information, for any balance owing, and for filing on time.</p>
</details>

<h2 id="h_2">When is an information return considered on time</h2>
<p>We considers the return to be filed on time if it meets <strong>one </strong>of the following conditions:</p>

<ul>
<li>it is received on or before the due date </li>
<li>it is postmarked on or before the due date </li>
</ul>
<p>When the due date falls on a Saturday, a Sunday, or a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/public-holidays.html">public holidays</a> recognized by the CRA, we consider your information return to be on time if we receive it on the next business day.</p>

<h2 id="h_3">What happens if you file late or you do not file</h2>
<p>There is a legislated penalty for failure to file an information return by the due date.</p>
<h3 id="h_0_0">Legislated penalty</h3>
<p><strong>Each slip is an information return</strong>, and the penalty we assess is based on the number of information returns you filed late. The penalty is $100 or the amount calculated according to the chart below, whichever is more:</p>

<h3 id="h_0_1">Relieving administrative policy</h3>
<p>You have to give your employee or recipient his or her slip and file your information return with the Canada Revenue Agency on or before the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/payroll/remitting-source-deductions/how-when-remit-due-dates.html">due date</a>. If the due date falls on a Saturday, a Sunday, or a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/public-holidays.html">public holiday</a> recognized by the CRA, your information return is due the next business day.</p>
<p>We consider your return to be filed on time if we receive it or if it is postmarked on or before the due date.</p>
<p>We may assess a penalty if you file your information return late. For certain information returns, we have an administrative policy that reduces the penalty that we assess so it is fair and reasonable for small businesses.</p>
<p>Each slip is an information return, and the penalty we assess is based on the number of information returns you filed late. The penalty is $100 or the amount calculated according to the chart below, whichever is more:</p>
