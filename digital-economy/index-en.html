<h1 property="name" id="wb-cont">Digital economy for simplified GST/HST</h1>
     <p>As of <span class="nowrap">July 1, 2021,</span> digital economy businesses, including <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/digital-economy/digital-economy-gsthst/digital-economy-definitions.html#h_5">digital platform operators</a>, may have potential goods and services tax/harmonized sales tax (GST/HST) obligations under three proposed measures that were <a href="https://www.budget.gc.ca/fes-eea/2020/report-rapport/anx4-en.html#sales-tax-measures">announced</a> by the Government of Canada. This means you may have new obligations, including registering, and charging and collecting the GST/HST.  
		<!-- <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/gst-hst-businesses.html">register for the current standard GST/HST</a> or the proposed simplified GST/HST. -->
	</p>
	<p>Depending on the type of business in which you are involved you may also be affected by more than one of the measures and will need to consider their combined impact on your business.  Even if you are not required to register and charge and collect GST/HST, your customers may have to begin paying GST/HST on your supplies if they are facilitated through a distribution platform.  </p>
     <p>Types of businesses affected by each measure:  </p>
	 <h2 class="h3">Cross-border digital products and services</h2>
          <p>These are non-resident vendors who <strong>sell taxable digital products and services</strong>, such as online music streaming or traditional services, to Canadian consumers and Canadian entities who are not registered under the normal GST/HST regime. Also, <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/digital-economy/digital-economy-gsthst/digital-economy-definitions.html#h_5">distribution platform operators</a> who make or facilitate such supplies through their platform.  A simplified GST/HST registration, reporting and remittance system will be available to non-resident vendors and non-resident distribution platform operators under this proposed measure.</p>
               <h2 class="h3">Sale of goods located in Canada</h2>
			   <p>These are non-resident vendors who <strong>make taxable sales of goods</strong> that are delivered or made available to the purchaser in Canada, including goods that are located in Canada, such as in a fulfillment warehouse or shipped from a place in Canada to a purchaser in Canada. Also, <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/digital-economy/digital-economy-gsthst/digital-economy-definitions.html#h_5">distribution platform operators</a> who sell or facilitate the sale of such goods through their platform.</p>
				  <h2 class="h3">Platform-based short-term accommodation</h2>
				  <p>These are suppliers of taxable short-term accommodation in Canada that are facilitated through an <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/digital-economy/digital-economy-gsthst/digital-economy-definitions.html#h_1">accommodation platform</a> by an <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/digital-economy/digital-economy-gsthst/digital-economy-definitions.html#h_2">accommodation platform operator</a>. Also, <strong>accommodation platform operators</strong> who facilitate such supplies through their platform.  A simplified GST/HST registration, reporting and remittance system will be available to non-resident <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/digital-economy/digital-economy-gsthst/digital-economy-definitions.html#h_1">accommodation platform</a> by an <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/digital-economy/digital-economy-gsthst/digital-economy-definitions.html#h_2">accommodation platform operators</a> under this proposed measure.</p>
