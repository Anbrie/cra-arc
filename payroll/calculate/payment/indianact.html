<h1 property="name" id="wb-cont" class="gc-thickline">Workers who are registered, or entitled to be registered under the Indian Act</h1>
<p>For purposes of the tax exemption under section 87 of the Indian Act, the term <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/payroll/payroll-deductions-contributions/special-situations/indian-employees.html#dfntns">Indian</a> is used because it has a legal meaning in the Indian Act. Section 87 of the Indian Act exempts from taxation the personal property of an Indian situated on a reserve. The section 87 exemption only applies to an Indian as defined by the Indian Act. It does not apply to all Indigenous Peoples in Canada such as the Inuit or Métis. </p>
<p>You must report all income and deductions on a T4 or T4A slip for status Indian employees regardless of whether their income is taxable or exempt. </p>

<h2 id="h_1">Determine the status of the employee</h2>
<p>An Indian is defined in the Indian Act as an individual who is listed or is entitled to be listed in the Indian Register. The Indian Register is the official record identifying all Indians who are registered in Canada. Indigenous Services Canada is responsible for the Indian Register and is the only one authorized to issue a "certificate of Indian status" to an individual.</p>
<h3 id="h_1_1">Your employee is registered as a status Indian under the Indian Act</h3>
<p>Depending on your situation, the employment income of status Indians may be exempt from tax. It is the income that is exempt from tax and not the person. </p>
<p>The rules for CPP and EI are different. EI premiums are always required and income that is exempt from income tax is not pensionable employment although you or the employee may elect into the plan.</p>
<p>To determine if the income is exempt from tax, refer to: <a href="#h_2">Determine the residency of the employee or employer</a>.</p>

<h3 id="h_1_2">Your employee is a treaty beneficiary of a First Nation with a final or self-government agreement that ends the tax exemption under section 87 of the Indian Act</h3>
<p>The employment income is taxable if your employee is a treaty beneficiary of a First Nation with a final or <a href="https://www.rcaanc-cirnac.gc.ca/eng/1100100032275/1529354547314">self-government</a> agreement that ends the tax exemption under section 87 of the Indian Act.</p>
<p>You need to deduct CPP, EI and income tax for this employee, same as your regular employees.</p>

<p>Some First Nations have signed an agreement with the government of Canada to become self-governing Nations. As a result, even though they have Indian status, their members <strong>gave up their tax exemption </strong>provided by section 87 of the Indian Act.</p>
<ul>
<li>Members of such First Nations are usually taxed on their income in the same manner as other Canadians. </li>
<li>They are asked to identify themselves on the first page of their tax return as residing on a settlement land of an Aboriginal government at the end of the year. They are also asked to confirm whether they are citizens or members of these Indigenous governments. Such details are necessary when part of their federal, provincial or territorial tax is transferred to their Indigenous government in accordance with the agreement.  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="h_1_3">Your employee is not registered as a status Indian under the Indian Act</h3>
<p>The employment income is taxable if your employee is not registered as a status Indian under the Indian Act. The section 87 exemption <strong>only applies to an Indian as defined by the Indian Act</strong>.</p>
<p>You need to deduct CPP, EI and income tax for this employee, same as your regular employees.</p>
