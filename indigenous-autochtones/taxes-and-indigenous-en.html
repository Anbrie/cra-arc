		We want you to be aware of the benefits and requirements that apply to you.

</p>
<h2 id="getting">Getting benefits and credits</h2>
<p>Indigenous peoples have access to the same benefits and credits as other Canadians. If you don't usually file a tax return, you won't be able to get some of those benefits and credits.</p>

<h3>File a tax return every year</h3>
		<!-- <p>Even if your income is exempt from tax or you don't owe any taxes, you should file your return every year. That way you will keep getting any benefits, credits, and related provincial and territorial payments you are entitled to.</p> -->
		<p>
			To continue getting your benefit and credit payments, you need to do your taxes on time <strong>every year</strong>, even if your income is tax exempt or you had no income at all. If you have a spouse or common-law partner, they also need to do their taxes every year so that the CRA can calculate your payments.
		</p>
		<h3>You must file a tax and benefit return to get any of the following:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>GST/HST credit</li>
				<li>Canada child benefit (CCB)</li>
				<li>Child disability benefit</li>
				<li>Disability Tax Credit</li>
				<li>Northern Residents Deduction</li>
				<li>Canada Workers Benefit</li>
				<li>Canada Training Credit</li>		
			</ul>

		<p>The CERB is generally a taxable benefit.

		<p>If you mistakenly received COVID-19 emergency benefit payments, or your situation has changed since you first applied for one of these benefits, you can repay the CRA via My Account, online banking, or mail.</p>
		<p>The CRA is sympathetic to the fact that, for some individuals, repayment of these amounts may have financial implications. For this reason, payment arrangement parameters have been expanded to give people more time and flexibility to repay based on their ability to pay. If you can't make a payment in full, contact the CRA to make a payments arrangement.</p>

		<summary>How do I collect the 10% tax withheld if my income is tax-exempt?</summary>
		<p>If you received one of the recovery benefits, 10% of the tax was withheld at source - even if your income is exempt from tax. </p>
		<p>You may be able to get part or all of the tax back for payments received in 2020 or 2021 by <strong>filing a tax return for that year</strong>. You may be eligible if:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>some or all of your income is exempt from tax under section 87 of the Indian Act</li>
			<li>you are registered, or entitled to be registered as an Indian under that Act</li>
		</ul> 
		<p>This may include filling out Form <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t90.html">T90 Income exempt under the Indian Act</a> as part of the return. Or you may be eligible to use a <a href="#simplereturn">simplified return</a>.</p>

				If you received one of the Canada recovery benefits 10% of the tax was withheld at source, including those individuals with income that may be exempt from tax. If some or all of your income is exempt from tax under section 87 of the Indian Act and you are registered, or entitled to be registered as an Indian under that Act, you may be able to get part or all of the tax back for payments received in 2020 or 2021 by filing a tax return for that year.

		<summary>I am a First Nation individual, will the recovery benefits received in 2020 be exempt from tax under section 87 of the Indian Act?</summary>
		<p>The recovery benefits you receive will be treated in the same way as the total income that entitled you to these benefits.</p>
		<p>The recovery benefits are available to workers who earned a minimum total income of $5,000 from one or more of the following sources; employment income, self-employment income and/or provincial or federal benefits related to maternity or paternity leave.  Total income includes income exempt under section 87 of the Indian Act.</p>
		<p>If the recovery benefits are in respect of a two-week period beginning in 2020, this total income is your total income for either 2019 or the 12-month period preceding the day on which you made your application (straddle period). </p> 
		<p> Therefore, if the total income that entitled you to the recovery benefits in either 2019 or the straddle period is exempt from tax under section 87 of the Indian Act, your recovery benefits will also be exempt. If the total income that entitled you to the recovery benefits is partially exempt from tax in both 2019 and the straddle period, your recovery benefits will also be partially exempt. </p> 
		<p> Your recovery benefits will be treated as exempt in the same proportion as the total income of the period that is more advantageous to you.  If the total income that entitled you to the recovery benefits in one period is partially exempt and the total income in the other is taxable, your recovery benefits will be treated as exempt in the same proportion as the total income of the period that was partially exempt. If the total income that entitled you to the recovery benefits is taxable in both periods, your recovery benefits will also be taxable.</p>
		<p>In addition, if you have a combination of taxable and exempt income and you had a reduction of at least 50% in your average weekly employment income or self-employment income that includes a reduction of exempt income, for reasons related to COVID-19, the recovery benefits you received may be exempt in the proportion of the exempt income lost over the total income lost, if this proportion is more advantageous to you.</p>

		<p>The recovery benefits are available to workers who earned a minimum total income of $5,000 from one or more of the following sources; employment income, self-employment income and/or provincial or federal benefits related to maternity or paternity leave.  Total income includes income exempt under section 87 of the Indian Act.</p>
		<p>If the recovery benefits are in respect of a two-week period beginning in 2021, this total income is your total income for either 2019, 2020, or in the 12-month period preceding the day on which you made your application (straddle period).</p> 
		<p> Therefore, if the total income that entitled you to the benefits in 2019, 2020 or the straddle period is exempt from income tax under section 87 of the Indian Act, your recovery benefits will also be exempt. If the total income that entitled you to the Canada recovery benefits is partially exempt from tax in all the  periods, your Canada recovery benefits will also be partially exempt. </p> 
		<p>The recovery benefits will be treated as exempt in the same proportion as the total income of the period that is more advantageous to you. If your total income that entitled you to the recovery benefits in two periods is partially exempt and the total income in the other period is taxable, your recovery benefits will be treated as exempt in the same proportion as the total income of the period that was partially exempt that is more advantageous to you. </p> 
		<p>If your total income that entitled you to the recovery benefits in one period is partially exempt and the total income in the other periods is taxable, your recovery benefits will be treated as exempt in the same proportion as the total income of the period that was partially exempt. </p> 
		<p>If your total income that entitled you to the recovery benefits is taxable in all  periods, your recovery benefits will also be taxable.</p>
		<p>In addition, if you have a combination of taxable and exempt income and you had a reduction of at least 50% in your average weekly employment income or self-employment income that includes a reduction of exempt income, for reasons related to COVID-19, the recovery benefits you received may be exempt in the proportion of the exempt income lost over the total income lost, if this proportion is more advantageous to you.</p>

		<summary>If the CRB you received is exempt from tax under section 87 of the Indian Act, should it be included in your income determined under Part I of the Income Tax Act (the Act)?</summary>
		<p>No. The exempt CRB should not be included in your income pursuant to paragraph 81(1)(a) of the Act. Paragraph 81(1)(a) of the Act provides that amounts which are exempt from income tax by any other enactment of the Parliament of Canada (includes the Indian Act) shall
		not be included in computing the income of a taxpayer for a taxation year. Accordingly, the exempt income of an Indian under the Indian Act is not included in computing the income of a taxpayer under Part I of the Act.</p>
		<p>However, it should be noted that if the CRB received by an individual is not exempt from tax under section 87 of the Indian Act, it will be included in the individual’s income in accordance with subparagraph 56(1)(r)(iv) of the Act.</p>
		</details>
		<details>
		<summary>If an individual was in receipt of the CRB in 2020 or 2021 and their entire income for 2020 or 2021 is exempt from tax under section 87 of the Indian Act, will the individual be subject to the repayment in that year?</summary>
		<p>No. An individual whose entire income in 2020 or 2021 is exempt from tax under section 87 of the Indian Act will not be subject to the CRB repayment in that year even if their income is greater than $38,000 for that year.</p>
		<p>An individual’s “income” as defined in subsection 8(3) of the Canada Recovery Benefits Act (the CRBA) is determined under part I of the Income Tax Act. Paragraph 81(1)(a) of the Act excludes income exempt under section 87 of the Indian Act when computing the income of a
		taxpayer for a taxation year under Part I of the Act. </p> 
		<p>The CRBA does not have a specific provision to include the section 87 exempt income for the purpose of calculating the income for repayment in subsection 8(2) of the CRBA. Pursuant to subsection 8(3) of the CRBA, an
		individual’s income exempt under section 87 of the Indian Act is not included in the calculation of income, and therefore, the individual is not subject to the CRB repayment specified in subsection 8(2) of the CRBA.</p>
		</details>
		<details>
		<summary>If an individual was in receipt of the CRB in 2020 or 2021 and has both exempt income and other income that is not exempt from tax in that year, will the individual be subject to the repayment in that year?</summary>
		<p>It depends on the facts of a particular situation. Pursuant to subsection 8(2) of the CRBA, an individual is required to repay an amount equal to 50 cents for every dollar of income earned in that year above $38,000 of income, up to the total amount of the CRB received by them in that
		year. </p> 
		<p>Accordingly, if the individual has other income that is not exempt from tax that exceeds the stated amount of $38,000, they will be subject to the repayment of the CRB regardless of whether or not they have exempt income. On the other hand, if the individual’s other income that
		is not exempt from tax is less than or equal to $38,000 for 2020 or 2021, the individual will not be subject to the repayment in that year.</p>

	<h3 id="cesb">Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB)</h3>
		<details>
			<summary>Will the CESB be exempt from tax under section 87 of the Indian Act?</summary>
			<p>No. The CESB is not considered to be situated on a reserve as there are insufficient factors connecting this income to a reserve. It is available to all Canadians who qualify and are paid from general government funds. This benefit is not paid by First Nations or with money specifically set aside for First Nation
				individuals. </p> 
				<p>Furthermore, similar to a social assistance payment or an old age security payment, the CESB is available to all eligible individuals regardless of whether they are First Nation individuals or whether they earned income in 2019 or in the 12-month period prior to the date of their application. </p> 
				<p>
				The fact that the recipient is a First Nation individual residing on a reserve is not sufficient to result in the benefit being situated on a reserve, and therefore, it is not exempt from tax under section 87 of the Indian Act.</p>
		</details>
		<details>
			<summary>Will the CESB be treated like an old age security (OAS) payment?</summary>
			<p>The OAS payment is a monthly payment available to seniors aged 65 and older who meet the Canadian citizenship and residency requirements. Old age security income has never been considered to be personal property situated on a reserve because it does not have any reserve connection and therefore, it remains taxable.</p> 
			<p>
				There are differences between the eligibility requirements of the CESB and the OAS. Unlike the OAS, which only has an age and Canadian citizenship and residency requirements, the CESB has other eligibility requirements which may be considered as connecting factors. However, it is our view that these factors are
				not significant enough to connect the CESB to a reserve and therefore, the CESB will be taxable.</p>
		</details>
		<details>
			<summary>Does the CESB have to be included on line 7 of Form T90?</summary>
			<p>No. Form T90, Income exempt from tax under the Indian Act, is mainly used to calculate a First Nation individual's total exempt working income (line 4) and net exempt income (line 17) for purposes of the Canada workers benefit. Line 7 of Form T90 E(20) refers to the federal, provincial, or territorial government COVID-19
				payments received in the year. </p> 
				<p>The instruction for what amounts to be entered on line 7 of Form T90 E(20) further clarifies that only the exempt portion of the COVID-19 payments received from the federal, provincial, or territorial government be entered on line 7. </p> 
				<p>The CESB is not exempt from tax under section 87 of the
				Indian Act and therefore, should not be included on line 7 of Form T90.</p>
