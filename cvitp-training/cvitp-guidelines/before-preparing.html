  <p>A Community Volunteer Income Tax  Program (CVITP) volunteer can take on many different roles. The following  guidelines will provide you with suggestions and tips to help you succeed whether you  prepare tax returns or provide support.</p>

<section class="alert alert-info">
  <p>To ensure the program's success, organizations and volunteers must safeguard taxpayer information and understand their responsibilities in this respect.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Do not use or disclose the individual's information for any purpose other than to complete their return</li>
    <li>Store the individual's information securely in a locked drawer or cabinet and never leave  their information unattended</li>
    <li>Be mindful of your surroundings when speaking with individuals, especially in a virtual clinic setting when other people are present in your home or you have technological devices such as Google Home or Alexa</li>
    <li>In the event of any type of security breach, such as lost, stolen or compromised data, tell your community organization and your Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) coordinator immediately</li>

  </ul>
  <h2 id="h1">Screening for eligibility</h2>
  <p>You must screen the  individual&rsquo;s information to ensure they meet the eligibility criteria for the CVITP   . For more information, refer to the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/community-volunteer-income-tax-program/lend-a-hand-individuals/about.html" target="_blank">eligibility  criteria</a> under Introduction  to free tax clinics.</p>
  <p> <strong>File my Return</strong></p>
  <p>    This  CRA service offers eligible individuals the ability to file their tax return by  answering a series of short questions through an automated phone service. Only  individuals who receive an invitation letter from the CRA can participate. </p>
  <p>If  during the screening process an individual confirms they received a File my  Return invitation letter, volunteers should verify if they contacted the CRA. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>If they  have <strong>not</strong> yet contacted the CRA, volunteers may suggest they do so, or  offer to complete their tax return in person or virtually by using the provided  tax preparation software </li>
    <li>If the  individual contacted the CRA to use File my Return, no further action is  required on the volunteer&rsquo;s behalf </li>
  </ul>
  <p>For  more information on this automated service, refer to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/campaigns/file-my-return.html">File my Return</a>. </p>
  <h2 id="h2">Confirming the individual's identity </h2>
  <p>You must get proof of identity from the  individual before you prepare  their return.</p>
  <p>    Proof of identity  must:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>be valid</li>
    <li>be government issued</li>
    <li>include a photo</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Examples of valid  identification include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>provincial or territorial (or equivalent abroad)  driver's license or photo identification</li>
    <li>Canadian or foreign passport</li>
    <li>Indian status and identification card</li>
    <li>military or other government employee  identification card</li>
  </ul>
  <p>How to confirm the individual&rsquo;s identity  in <strong>virtual clinics </strong>using <strong>one</strong> of the options:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The organization may have already confirmed an individual&rsquo;s  identity and you will be advised if this is the case. You may also already know  the individual personally and can confirm their identity. If so, you do not  need to authenticate further.</li>
    <li>Using a video-conferencing application, you can visually confirm  the individual&rsquo;s identification on camera. Ask the individual to display their  photo ID for verification.</li>
    <li>You may use Auto-fill my return (AFR) to confirm the individual&rsquo;s  identity. You will need to review the information in Before you begin  and how to use AFR . Once the AFR process is  completed confirm their identity using the information exported. 
		<ul>
      <li>For example, without divulging any  information, you may ask the individual to confirm their employer&rsquo;s name, their  source of income or the amount showing in a specific box on one of their slips.</li>
		</ul>
	  </li>
      <li>If you are unable to use options 1, 2 or 3, you may contact the  CRA by email and request that they confirm the individual&rsquo;s identity over the  phone.
	  
<p><strong>How to email the CRA</strong> <br>
    Send  an email to <a href="mailto:VIRTUALG@cra-arc.gc.ca">VIRTUALG@cra-arc.gc.ca</a> with &ldquo;Taxpayer&rsquo;s authentication&rdquo;  in the subject line.  In the body of the  email, include the following information:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>Date and time the volunteer spoke  to the individual - with the time zone details</li>
      <li>Volunteer&rsquo;s full name, province  and the first three digits of their EFILE number, if applicable</li>
      <li>Individual&rsquo;s name, contact  information and language of correspondence</li>
      <li>Call back date and time requested </li>
  </ul>		  
		  
	  
	  </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>You can  include the names of up to five individuals in each email to the CRA. </p>

<section class="alert alert-info">
	
	<p>The CRA will make every effort to call the    individual at the date and time requested, however this may not always be    possible. </p>
        <p>Advise the individual:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>to    expect a call within one (1) business day or on the requested date and time </li>
          <li>to    expect the CRA agent to confirm the date the individual and the volunteer determined    (this will ensure the individual is not dealing with a fraudster)</li>
          <li>to be    ready to respond to the CRA employee&rsquo;s questions to confirm their identity by    having information such as prior year tax returns, T4 slips, etc. available  </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The CRA will advise you, the    volunteer, by email of the outcome of the call. If the individual&rsquo;s identity    was confirmed, you can contact the individual and proceed with completing    their return. If not, follow the instructions provided in the email.</p>
	
	</section>	

<section class="alert alert-warning">
<p>The CRA will try to offer assistance    in the preferred language of the individual, however this may not always be    possible. Usually, if a preferred language request is made, the turnaround    time on the call may be longer than one (1) business day.</p>
</section>
	
	
  <p>If you are assisting  the individual&rsquo;s legal  representative or executor, it is important to validate their identity and ensure  they show proof of the Power of attorney (POA)they have for the individual for whom you are  preparing a tax return. If they do not have the legal documentation on hand,  you can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>contact the dedicated help line for volunteers </li>
    <li>have the individual speak with the CRA telephone  agent to answer confidentiality questions</li>
    <li>confirm if the CRA has a record of the authorization  on file </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Signing form TIS60 in  virtual clinics</h3>
	
  <p>If you are participating in a free virtual clinic, you can get an  individual&rsquo;s verbal consent in lieu of signing the authorizations, by video  conference, telephone, or the method pre-arranged by your organization.  However, individuals must be aware and agree to the following conditions:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>You are a volunteer under the  CVITP and not acting as an agent of the Canada Revenue Agency 
<details>
  <summary>Read the script to the individual: </summary>
  <p> Hello,  my name is (insert name). I&rsquo;m a volunteer from the Community Volunteer Income  Tax Program. I will prepare your income tax and benefits return(s)  electronically for you with the information you supplied. </p>
  <p> I  am a volunteer with (organization name) here to provide this service to you. I  am not an employee of the Canada Revenue Agency. </p>
  <p> Do  I have your permission to complete and file your income tax return? </p>
		</details>	
    </li>
    <li>The method(s) of communication may  potentially be unsecure 
<details>
  <summary>Read the script to the individual: </summary>
  <p>We will be discussing your  personal information so that I may prepare your tax return. I have and will  continue to take all reasonable efforts to ensure information is kept safe,  however, the method of communication we are using may not be secure. </p>
  <p>Regarding  use of cell phone, video or email:</p>
  <p> Do you consent to the use of a <strong>cell phone or cordless telephone</strong> to  discuss information needed to prepare your income tax and benefits return(s)? </p>
  <p>Do you consent to the use of <strong>videoconference</strong> (insert name of  application) to discuss information needed to prepare your income tax and  benefits return(s)?</p>
  <p>Do you consent to the use of <strong>unsecure email</strong> to exchange written  discussions, communication and documents needed to prepare your income tax and  benefits return(s)? </p>
	</details>
    </li>
    <li>Service will not be provided if the  individual chooses to discontinue the call 
  <details>
  <summary>Read the script to the individual: </summary>
  <p>You may choose to discontinue this  call at any time. If you choose to do so, or fail to provide the information needed  to prepare your tax return, I will not be able to assist you.</p>
    <p>Do you acknowledge what I just  read to you?</p>
	  </details>
    </li>	
	</ol>
  <p>Once you receive verbal consent, Section I – Authorization of the  TIS60 is considered completed.</p>
  <h2 id="h4">Gathering and verifying the individual&rsquo;s information </h2>
  <p>Organizing the slips  and receipts as they apply to the different sections of the Income Tax Return  may help you create an efficient working method. For example, keeping all T4  slips together so they are easy to find when entering employment income  information in the tax software, can save you a lot of time.</p>
  <p> The most common  information slips and receipts may include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>T4, T5, T5007, T4AA and  T4(OAS)</li>
    <li>receipts for child care, medical expenses, and RRSP  contributions</li>
    <li>charitable donation receipts, including those made  in the current year and any donations made and not claimed within the last 5  years</li>
    <li>tuition receipts, such as T2202, TL11A, or TL11B</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Confirm with the  individual that they verified the accuracy of the information reported on the  slips (for example, name, SIN, and issuer). If a slip has inaccurate information,  the individual must contact the issuer of the slip to have it corrected. Individuals&nbsp;waiting  for slip issue to be resolved, are still encouraged to file by the deadline.  This will ensure there are no interruptions to any benefit or credit payments they  may be entitled to, and helps avoiding late-filing penalties.</p>
  <p> To make sure you  have all the information needed to prepare a tax return, ask the individual you  are assisting the following questions: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>How many tax years do you need me to prepare for  you? For what years?</li>
    <li>Do you have any family members, such as a spouse or  common-law partner, who must also file their tax return?</li>
    <li>Do you have children or other dependants? How many?  What are their ages?</li>
    <li>Have you, your spouse or dependant(s) (if  applicable) been approved for the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/community-volunteer-income-tax-program/lend-a-hand-individuals/training-volunteers/scenarios/disabilities.html" target="_blank">T2201, Disability Tax Credit Certificate</a>?</li>
    <li>How many sources of income did you have this year?  For example, multiple employers and interest income.</li>
    <li>Has you living situation changed within the last  year? This may include a change in marital status, address, or dependants  (custody change, adoption, additional dependants)?</li>
    <li>Did you receive or earn any tips?</li>
  </ul>

<section class="alert alert-warning">	
  <p>Keep in mind, questions you need to ask may not    be limited to this list!</p>
</section>
	
  <p>How to obtain information if an individual is missing a slip</p>
  <ul>
    <li>use Auto-fill my return</li>
    <li>call the dedicated help line for volunteers at&nbsp;1-866-398-3488 </li>
    <li>advise the individual to contact their employer or  payer</li>
    <li>use pay stubs or statements to estimate the missing  income and deductions </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The individual must be  present if you call the dedicated help line for volunteers to obtain their  information. The individual will need to answer confidentiality questions. If  confidentiality is met, the individual can provide the agent with verbal  authorization for you to speak on their behalf. Verbal authorization is only  valid for the duration of that telephone call.<br>
  </p>

<section class="alert alert-warning">		
<p>If you know or suspect that the information an    individual provides to you is not accurate or contains omissions, withdraw    your services.</p>
	</section>
	
  <h2 id="h5">Entering and verifying your user information</h2>
  <p>Before you start  preparing tax returns, make sure you always enter your user information in the  UFile CVITP, EFILE-NetFile setup. You will need the following information on  hand:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>your EFILE number and password</li>
