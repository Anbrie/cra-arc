		 <h2>Why are we doing it?</h2>

<p>There are currently more than 96 million web pages on the gc.ca domain including over 130,000 pages on the CRA Web site. Mandatory compliance with the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0</a> will require page level analysis and action since Government of Canada (GC) cannot serve or inform citizens effectively if they have to wade through Redundant, Outdated and Trivial (ROT) content to find information.</p>

<p>In an effort to make information easily findable and useful, it is imperative that the CRA is aware of the content published online. It is also crucial to ensure quality material is being published, evaluated and reviewed regularly to help deliver clear, accurate, and up-to-date information to our audience. This means deleting, consolidating or rewriting information, such as the act of taking five pages of Web content and turning it into one.</p>

<h2>How to Assess Content: Is it ROT?</h2>

<p>The following is a checklist that will help you to determine whether or not your content needs to be removed from the CRA Web site:</p>

<h3>Redundant</h3>

<ul>

<li>The program/organization is not the authoritative source for the content. </li>

<li>The information is duplicated elsewhere on the site, or on another partner’s site such as canada.gc.ca.</li>

<li>It’s mostly used by Agency staff. (You should save it on your Intranet instead.)</li>

</ul>

<h3>Outdated</h3>

<ul>

<li>Orphan pages: there is no way to navigate to the page online or the content no longer has an owner/author. </li>

<li>Outdated pages: for instance, time-sensitive media advisories, irrelevant topics, discontinued programs, past events. </li>

<li>Content that is written in the wrong tense (e.g. “will be” for a date in the past). </li>

<li>Content is not the same in English or French, or is missing content in one language. </li>

</ul>

<h3>Trivial</h3>

<ul>

<li>Content is not relevant or informative&nbsp;for the audience. </li>

<li>Web analytics show low or no page views or visits. </li>

<li>The title of the content doesn't match what is actually on the page. </li>

</ul>

<p>Consider keeping information for archiving online, <strong>even if it’s old</strong>, if:</p>

<ul>

<li>There is a legislative requirement to keep it publicly available (e.g. it is a proactive disclosure).</li>

<li>It records an important decision.</li>

<li>There is a risk associated with removing it (e.g. it could be politically embarrassing). </li>

</ul>

<h2>Reduce the ROT Cycle</h2>

<h3>Step 1 – Complete a content inventory</h3>

<ul>

<li>Crawl site</li>

<li>Identify page owners</li>

<li>Categorize pages</li>

</ul>

<p>This will be performed by the Digital Design and Production Directorate (PD) of the Public Affairs Branch. Recommendations for content removal will be provided to content owners.</p>

<h3>Step 2 – Evaluate and assess content</h3>

<ul>

<li>Review pages</li>

<li>Evaluate content</li>

</ul>

<p>This is to be performed by content owners with support from the PD.</p>

<h3>Step 3 – Archive web content</h3>

<ul>

<li>Archive online</li>

<li>Archive offline<strong></strong></li>

</ul>

<p>This is to be performed by content owners in collaboration with the PD.</p>

<h3>Step 4 – Rewrite and republish content</h3>

<ul>

<li>Rewrite for findability</li>

<li>Republish new content</li>

</ul>

<p>This is to be performed by content authors with support from the PD.</p>

<p><em>It is important that content is properly evaluated and assessed. The PD will&nbsp;help content owners through the process. For further information, please contact your PD Portfolio Manager. For more information about obtaining detailed guidance on the ROT process, please consult the </em><a href="http://www.gcpedia.gc.ca/gcwiki/images/8/82/ROT_FINALKIT.doc">Step-by-Step Guide for Reducing ROT</a> on <a href="http://www.gcpedia.gc.ca/gcwiki/index.php?title=GCPEDIA:Project&setlang=en&uselang=en">GCPedia</a>.</p>

<p>Redundant, outdated, or trivial (<abbr title="Redundant, outdated, or trivial">ROT</abbr>) content reduction is the first step in the intranet modernization process. <abbr title="Redundant, outdated, or trivial">ROT</abbr> on the intranet can cause a great deal of <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> employee inefficiency and dissatisfaction, from increasingly irrelevant search engine results to presenting incorrect information to the public and to employees. The goal of <abbr title="Redundant, outdated, or trivial">ROT</abbr> reduction is to ensure that all intranet content is authoritative, standardized, easy to find and understand, accessible, up to date, useful, and that it remains well managed. <abbr title="Redundant, outdated, or trivial">ROT</abbr> review and reduction are required before moving the remaining content into the new intranet template. This process is being rolled out across <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> in phases.</p>

<p>Here are some definitions to assist you in the <abbr title="Redundant, outdated, or trivial">ROT</abbr> review process:</p>

</div>

</div>

<dl>

<dt>Redundant:</dt>

<dd>The content is duplicated or substantially similar elsewhere on the intranet, <strong>and</strong> your division or program is not the authoritative source for the content.</dd>

<dt>Outdated:</dt>

<dd>The content refers to discontinued programs, past events or superseded documents. Or, the content is "orphaned"; that is, there is no way to navigate to it, or its context is missing or obsolete.</dd>

<dt>Trivial:</dt>

<dd>The content does not need to be on InfoZone as it limited in scope or accessed infrequently, and there are no legal or organizational risks in removing it.</dd>

</dl>

<div class="row">

<div class="col-md-12">

<h2>Determining content removal</h2>

<p>Content that receives fewer than 250 views or 120 downloads per year will be removed unless a business justification for keeping it on InfoZone is provided. 250 views of a webpage equals approximately 1 view per business day, per year.</p>

<p>Rather than keeping low-use or unauthoritative content with business value on InfoZone, it can be saved in another digital repository, such as the shared drive for recordkeeping purposes. <strong>Business value </strong>can be defined as content is useful to the health, productivity or well-being of the organization or group of individuals. Examples of content with business value include records of important decisions made, tools and references/resources, <abbr title="and so forth">etc</abbr>. Some content may have user value, but content without business value should not be on the intranet.</p>

<div class="alert alert-info">

<p>It is important that content owners are responsible for keeping information that is needed to meet program business needs, even after it is removed from InfoZone. To determine what business records you need to save prior to removal from InfoZone and how long you should save them, please consult the <a href="/english/r9999999/imrc/tlr/rcrdsdspstnthrts-e.html">disposition authority</a>. You can also contact the <a href="/english/r9999999/imrc/cct/index-e.html">Information management helpdesk</a> for guidance.</p>
