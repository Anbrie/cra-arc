	<h2>Canada child benefit</h2>
	<h3>What is the Canada child benefit</h3>
		<p> The Canada child benefit (CCB) is a <strong>tax-free</strong> monthly payment made to eligible families to help them with the cost of raising children under 18 years of age. You only need to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/canada-child-benefit-overview/canada-child-benefit-apply.html">apply once</a><br> to find out if you're eligible.</p>
		<p>After you apply for the CCB and once your tax return is assessed, the CRA will send you a notice telling you how much you will be receiving. CCB payments are issued on or about the 20th of each month.</p>
		<p>To continue getting your payments, you need to do your taxes every year, even if your income is tax exempt or you have no income at all. If you have a spouse or common-law partner, they will also have to do their taxes each year. The CRA uses the information from your income tax and benefit return to calculate your payment amounts.</p>
	<h3>How much can you get</h3>
	<p>You could get up to <strong>$6,833</strong> annually for each child under 6 and <strong>$5,765</strong> for each child aged 6 to 17.</p>
	<p>Use the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/child-family-benefits-calculator.html">child and family benefits calculator</a><br> to estimate your CCB payments</p>
	<h3>Retroactive payments</h3>
	<p>You can get the CCB payments for past years. To do so, <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/canada-child-benefit-overview/canada-child-benefit-apply.html">apply once</a><br> for the CCB. Then, if you haven't already, do your taxes for those years, so the CRA can calculate your payment amounts.</p>
	<p>CCB payments cannot be used to offset any taxes you may owe.</p>
	<p>Doing your taxes will not impact your tax exemption under Section 87 of the Indian Act. You can find more information on this and other tax and benefits related to Indigenous peoples here:</p>

	<h2>Disability Tax Credit</h2>
	<h3>What is the Disability tax credit?</h3>
	<p>The disability tax credit (DTC) is a non-refundable tax credit that helps persons with disabilities or their supporting persons reduce the amount of income tax they may have to pay.</p>
	<p>Being eligible for the DTC can open the door to other programs such as the registered disability savings plan and the child disability benefit.</p>
	<h3>How much can you claim?</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>$8,576</strong> if claiming for yourself</li>
		<li><strong>$2,273</strong> if claiming for your dependant</li>
		<li>up to <strong>$8,576</strong> if claiming for your spouse or common-law partner</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Tax credits and deductions are available for persons with disabilities, their supporting family members, and their caregivers.</p>

	<summary>Notes on this page</summary>
<p>This sub-page to the main Indigenous tax benefits page gives additional details about particular benefits, credits and deductions that might particular be of interest to or apply to Indigenous people. The parent page refers generally to the benefits and notes that you get some benefits if you file a tax return, even if you don't have taxable income. This page goes into more detail on the benefits themselves. </p>
<p>This is focused on benefits related to your taxes. That makes sense for the Disability tax credit, because it's a deduction off your income taxes. But even though the GST/HST credit is related to taxes, it's just cash you get. The Canada child benefit has no apparent connection to taxes. The key thing though, is that you can get them if you file your taxes.</p>
<p>Therefore, this content needs to not assume that people have any such understanding, or see any distinction between this and the sorts of things on the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/audience/indigenous.html">Benefits for indigeous peoples</a> page.</p>
<p>Finally, we have to modify the main Indigenous page content and possibly title to allow this to be a page that focuses on the benefits, credits and deductions, and that parent page to be more about taxes in general, if that is what's appropriate.</p>
