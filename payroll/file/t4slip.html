<h5>More than one T4 slip for the same employee</h5>
<p>When you give the same employee more than one T4 slip for the year, you should report the pensionable earnings amount for each period of employment in box 26 of each T4 slip.</p>
<h5>Example</h5>
<p>An employee earned $35,000 working in Ontario from January 2021 to June 2021 and earned $35,000 working in Quebec for the remainder of the year with the same employer. In addition to any other boxes that need to be filled out, report amounts in boxes 14 and 26 as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ontario T4 slip &ndash; box 14 = $35,000, and box 26 = $35,000 </li>
<li>Quebec T4 slip &ndash; box 14 = $35,000, and box 26 = $26,600 (calculated as the maximum pensionable earnings for 2021 of $61,600 &ndash; $35,000 already reported on T4 slip with Ontario as province of employment = $26,600) on the Quebec T4 slip </li>
</ul>
<h4>Benefits and earnings taxable only in Quebec</h4>
<p>Revenu Québec considers certain benefits and earnings to be pensionable earnings for employees working in Quebec. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Employer-paid private health benefit plan premiums </li>
<li>Assumed earnings &ndash; persons 55 years of age or older whose hours of work are reduced by reason of phased retirement may choose, with their employers, to make contributions to the QPP on all or part of the amount of the reduction in remuneration </li>

<h5>Box 26 greater than box 14</h5>
<p>The T4 slip will still be processed even though box 26 is more than box 14.</p>
<p>The following examples show how to fill in boxes 14 and 26 of your employee's T4 slip when you provide a benefit or earnings to an employee that is only taxable in Quebec. </p>
<h5>Example 1&ndash; Quebec taxable benefit, unpaid leave</h5>
<p>Marion works for her employer in Quebec and is on an unpaid leave of absence. Her employer pays $750 in premiums to an employer-paid private health benefit plan on her behalf. Since the benefit is not taxable outside of Quebec, it is not income. When preparing Marion's Quebec T4 slip, her employer will leave box 14 blank. Since the premiums are QPP pensionable, her employer will report $750 in box 26, the QPP contributions withheld on the benefit in box 17, and fill in any other boxes on her T4 slip as applicable.</p>
<h5>Example 2 &ndash; Quebec taxable benefit, other earnings</h5>
<p>During 2021, Julien received wages of $25,000 plus an $875 benefit that is only taxable in Quebec. When preparing Julien's Quebec T4 slip, his employer will report $25,000 in box 14, $25,875 in box 26, and fill in any other boxes on his T4 slip as applicable.</p>
<p><strong>Example 3 &ndash; Benefit is taxable both federally and in Quebec</strong></p>
<p>Stephane works for his employer in Quebec and did not receive any cash earnings. However, his employer gave him a non-cash housing benefit valued at $1,100. When preparing Stephane's Quebec T4 slip, his employer will report $1,100 in boxes 14 and 26, and fill in any other boxes on his T4 slip as applicable.</p>

<p>If you have to fill out more than one T4 slip for your employee because they worked in more than one province or territory, report the PA proportionately on each T4 slip. If you cannot apportion the PA, report the total amount on one slip.</p>
<p>If your employee participates in one or more RPP or DPSP, calculate their PA using the <strong>total </strong>amount of all pension credits accumulated by the employee under all these plans for the year.</p>
<p>If your employee is on a leave of absence and is still accruing pensionable service or credits under the plan, you must report the PA on a T4 slip. This is true even if the employee has no employment income in the tax year. Administrators of multi-employee plans (MEPs) should report the PA for the employee on leave on a <strong>T4A </strong>slip.</p>
<p><strong>Do not </strong>report any amount in box 52 if the employee participated in your RPP or DPSP and <strong>one </strong>of the following applies:</p>

<ul>
<li>The calculated PA is a negative amount or zero </li>
<li>The employee died during the year </li>
<li>The employee, even if they are still a member of the plan, no longer accrues new pension credits in the year (for example, The employee has accrued the maximum number of years of service in respect of the plan) </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h_0_1">Special rules concerning the PA</h3>
<p>Special calculation rules apply, in some circumstances, to employees who:</p>
