	<h2>Canada child benefit</h2>
	<h3>What is the Canada child benefit</h3>
		<p> The Canada child benefit (CCB) is a <strong>tax-free</strong> monthly payment made to eligible families to help them with the cost of raising children under 18 years of age. You only need to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/canada-child-benefit-overview/canada-child-benefit-apply.html">apply once</a><br> to find out if you're eligible.</p>
		<p>After you apply for the CCB and once your tax return is assessed, the CRA will send you a notice telling you how much you will be receiving. CCB payments are issued on or about the 20th of each month.</p>
		<p>To continue getting your payments, you need to do your taxes every year, even if your income is tax exempt or you have no income at all. If you have a spouse or common-law partner, they will also have to do their taxes each year. The CRA uses the information from your income tax and benefit return to calculate your payment amounts.</p>
	<h3>How much can you get</h3>
	<p>You could get up to <strong>$6,833</strong> annually for each child under 6 and <strong>$5,765</strong> for each child aged 6 to 17.</p>
	<p>Use the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/child-family-benefits-calculator.html">child and family benefits calculator</a><br> to estimate your CCB payments</p>
	<h3>Retroactive payments</h3>
	<p>You can get the CCB payments for past years. To do so, <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/canada-child-benefit-overview/canada-child-benefit-apply.html">apply once</a><br> for the CCB. Then, if you haven't already, do your taxes for those years, so the CRA can calculate your payment amounts.</p>
	<p>CCB payments cannot be used to offset any taxes you may owe.</p>
	<p>Doing your taxes will not impact your tax exemption under Section 87 of the Indian Act. You can find more information on this and other tax and benefits related to Indigenous peoples here:</p>

		<h2>If you receive a letter or message from the CRA</h2>
		<p>It's important to read these communications carefully. We might ask you to provide more information or documentation to confirm that you're eligible for a benefit or credit. For example, we may ask you to confirm that you are the primary caregiver for children in your care.</p>
		<h2>Documents to confirm your details</h2>
		<p>Your <strong>benefits may stop</strong> if you don't reply and provide all the information requested. If you do not have the documents or need some extra time to gather them, contact the CRA. Be sure to consider:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>what <strong>benefit</strong> the letter or message is about (for example, the CCB)?</li>
		<li>what <strong>eligibility criteria</strong> the letter or message is asking you to validate (for example, proof of dependents)</li>
		<li>what <strong>information or documents</strong> the message or letter says you can send<br>
		</li>
		<li>how the message or letter says you should <strong>send this information or documents</strong> (mail, fax or online)<br>

<details>
	<summary>Notes on this page</summary>
<p>This sub-page to the main Indigenous tax benefits page gives additional details about particular benefits, credits and deductions that might particular be of interest to or apply to Indigenous people. The parent page refers generally to the benefits and notes that you get some benefits if you file a tax return, even if you don't have taxable income. This page goes into more detail on the benefits themselves. </p>
<p>This is focused on benefits related to your taxes. That makes sense for the Disability tax credit, because it's a deduction off your income taxes. But even though the GST/HST credit is related to taxes, it's just cash you get. The Canada child benefit has no apparent connection to taxes. The key thing though, is that you can get them if you file your taxes.</p>
<p>Therefore, this content needs to not assume that people have any such understanding, or see any distinction between this and the sorts of things on the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/audience/indigenous.html">Benefits for indigeous peoples</a> page.</p>
<p>Finally, we have to modify the main Indigenous page content and possibly title to allow this to be a page that focuses on the benefits, credits and deductions, and that parent page to be more about taxes in general, if that is what's appropriate.</p>
