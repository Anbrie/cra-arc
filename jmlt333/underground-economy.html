 </ul>
 
		   <h2 id="h-1">What the underground economy is</h2>
		   <p>The underground economy includes any activity not reported for income tax and GST/HST purposes, which can include not reported or under-reported income from:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Tips and gratuities</li> 
 <li>Employment</li> 
 <li>Business</li> 
 <li>Money earned through the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/compliance/sharing-economy.html">sharing economy</a> such as renting out a room of your home and ride sharing</li> 
 <li>Gift cards received for work done</li> 
 <li>Cash payments for goods or services</li> 
 <li>Exchange of goods or services for other goods or services (bartering) without using money</li> 
 <li>Gifts received from suppliers (also called <a href="/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/compliance/incentive-income.html">incentives</a>)</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Generally, income you earn is taxable and you have to report it on your tax return. This is true even when you don’t receive a T4 slip and when the activity is not your main source of income.</p>
    
   
		   
		   
		   
		   
		   <h3 id="whatis">What is considered part of the underground economy</h3>
		   

		   
		   
		   
		   
		   <p>The underground economy is divided into 3 sectors:</p>
	       <div class="cnjnctn-type-and cnjnctn-xs">
<div class="cnjnctn-col">
<h4 class="mrgn-tp-sm text-muted">Hidden</h4>
<p>Economic activites that are productive and legal but are concealed from authorities due to individuals wanting to avoid taxes or increase the benefits they receive. </p>
	<p>For example, when a customer pays a contractor cash to avoid paying the GST/HST.</p>
</div>
<div class="cnjnctn-col">
<h4 class="mrgn-tp-sm text-muted">Informal</h4>
<p>Economic transactions with persons who provide goods and/or services but are not registered with the CRA.</p>
	<p>For example, when a self-employed individual provides cleaning services and does not register their business with the CRA.</p>
</div>
<div class="cnjnctn-col">
<h4 class="mrgn-tp-sm text-muted">Illegal</h4>
<p>Economic transactions that are illegal.</p>
	<p>For example, when a criminal profits from activities such as selling stolen goods and does not report their income.</p>
</div></div>
		   <p>According to <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/201023/dq201023a-eng.htm">Statistics Canada</a>, 4 industries have been the main contributors to underground economic activity in Canada since they began tracking this data in 1992:</p>
		   <ul>
			   <li>Residential construction</li>
			   <li>Retail trade</li>
			   <li>Finance, insurance, real estate</li>
			   <li>Rental, leasing and holding companies</li>
			   <li>Accomodation and food services</li>
		   </ul>
	       
	       
		   <h3>What is not part of the underground economy</h3>
		   <p>The underground economy is not the only form of tax non-compliance. The CRA is actively working to reduce other areas of non-compliance such as:</p>
		   <details>
			   <summary>Agressive tax planning</summary>
			   <p>Refers to arrangements that "push the limits" of acceptable tax planning.</p>
		   </details>
		   
		    <details>
			   <summary>Tax avoidance</summary>
			   <p>Refers to tax planning to reduce taxes in a way that is inconsistent with the overall spirit of the law.</p>
		   </details>
		   
		    <details>
			   <summary>Tax evasion</summary>
			   <p>Refers to a criminal offense, characterized by illegal activity that either ignores tax laws or refuses to comply with legislated reporting requirements. </p>
		   <p>While the underground economy is generally considered a civil offense (not criminal), someone participating in it could be charged with tax evasion if their actions are severe enough.</p>
		   </details>

		   <h2 id="h-2">Who does it affect</h2>
		   <p>All Canadians are affected by the continued presence of the underground economy.</p>
	  <p>The underground economy negatively affects economic growth in Canada as legitimate businesses struggle to compete with those that operate within <a href="#whatis">one of the sectors</a>.</p>
		      
		   	<p>When an employee, or a self-employed person underreports their income and/or benefits, they are potentially participating in the underground economy. This results in an increase in the tax gap.</p>
<details>
	<summary>What a tax gap is</summary>
	<p>The difference between the taxes that would be paid if all tax obligations were fully met, and the actual amount of taxes that are freely paid or collected by the CRA. The tax gap measures the amount of potential tax revenue loss, and that loss of tax revenue affects all of us.</p>
	<p>For more information, visit <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/corporate-reports-information/tax-gap-overview.html">Tax gap overview</a>.</p> 
		   </details>
		   <br>
		   
		   
		   <p>Claiming a full income and/or taxable benefits from employment means that Canadians are paying the taxes they owe, and that helps strengthen our community and our country by funding many services that we use every day.</p>
		   <p>Taxes pay for Canada’s world-renowned programs and services including the COVID-19 benefits, the Canada child benefit, Old Age Security, Employment Insurance, and national parks and monuments. </p>
		
		   
		   
		   
		   
		   <h2 id="h-3">What the CRA is doing</h2>
		   <p>Prior to 2022, the CRA published three guiding documents, covering the periods <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/corporate-reports-information/results-underground-economy-strategy-2015-2018.html">2015-2018</a>, <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/corporate-reports-information/underground-economy-strategy-2018-2021.html">2018-2021</a>, and <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/corporate-reports-information/underground-economy-business-plan-2021-2022.html">2021-2022</a> to communicate the areas of focus and the lessons learned. Each subsequent document was built on the work and priorities identified in the previous document, while adding to the Agency’s body of knowledge.  </p>
		   <h3>2022+ Underground Economy Strategy</h3>
		   
		   
		   <p>The CRA has taken an evergreen approach for the 2022+ Strategy based on its improved understanding of the complex nature of this economy.</p>
		   <p>The focus is to:</p>
		   <details>
			   <summary><strong>Identify</strong> underground economic activities</summary>
			   <p>Identify activites by improving efficiency and effectiveness of data research, analysis and third party data collection process. Through enhanced use of data and analytics, the CRA can more readily identify UE activities as they arise, and address them early on.</p>
		   </details>
		   <details>
			   <summary><strong>Prevent</strong> underground economic activities</summary>
			   <p>Prevent activites from occurring through early outreach and ongoing visibility. The CRA is expanding its tax education programs to work with those who unintentionally participate in the UE and make it easier to comply. </p>
			   <p>In addition to its <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/compliance/liaison-officer-initiative-loi.html">Liaison Officer service</a>, the Agency is working on other programs related to prevention, including assisted compliance, and a trade school initiative. Through these channels, the Agency will be able to communicate the effects of the UE and the role that taxpayers can play in minimizing the size of the UE. </p>
		   <p>This approach is shown to have a positive effect in reducing the participation of taxpayers in the UE. A focus on providing early tax education of taxpayers entering into business or new Canadians coming into the country, can also help prevent non-compliance. </p>
			   
		   </details>
		   <details>
			   <summary><strong>Address</strong> underground economic activities</summary>
			   <p>Address activites using collaborative and tailored approaches based on whether the activities are hidden, informal or illegal. The Agency has at its disposal a wide range of tools to address the presence of UE activities that are not as easily discouraged by the educational campaigns. The Agency will implementing a collaborative approach in designing tools to address the more resistant aspects of the UE. </p>
		   </details>
		   
		   <br>
		   
		   
		   
		   <p>The CRA will continue to:</p>
		   <ul>
			   <li>Communicate to Canadians what it is doing to make sure everyone is paying their fair share, and how it is working to deter non-compliance among those who are unknowingly or proactively participating in the underground economy.</li>
		   <li>Build trust in the tax system by assisting employees to claim their full income, and reducing the size of the non-filer population</li>
		   </ul>
		   
		   <h2 id="h-4">How you can help</h2>
		   <p>You can anonymously report underground activity through the CRA's <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/suspected-tax-cheating-in-canada-how-report.html">Informant Leads Program</a></p>
		   <p>You can voluntarily come forward to fix error or omissions in your tax filings before CRA contacts you about it. You can do this through CRA's <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/voluntary-disclosures-program-overview.html">Voluntary Disclosures Program</a>.</p>
