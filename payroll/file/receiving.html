<p>Every year, the CRA reviews the information on the T4 slips to ensure that the following figures match:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Required </strong>amounts of CPP and EI calculated from the employee's pensionable and insurable earnings </li>
<li><strong>Reported </strong>amounts of CPP and EI on the employee's T4 slips </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h_2_2">How are the results provided</h3>
<p>If there are discrepancies between the required and reported amounts, the results are printed on a PIER listing. If you report electronically and report an employee number on the T4 slip, you can view the employee number on the PIER listing.</p>
<p>The report includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>PIER listing which includes the affected employees and the figures used by CRA in the calculations </li>
<li>PIER summary that shows any balance due </li>
</ul>
<details><summary>Examples of common errors </summary>

<ul>

<li>An employee's change of age has resulted in a change in pensionable status (turned 18 or 70) </li>
<li>The SIN and/or name on the T4 was entered incorrectly </li>
<li>An employee has exceeded the maximum rate of CPP and/or EI contributions but you did not stop the deductions </li>

<ul>
<li>PIER information will be available in MyBA and RAC for the last 5 years </li>
<li>You can view, download, and reply to the PIER letter in MyBA or RAC </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mail if you are not registered for the electronic services </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h_2_5">How to respond to a PIER</h3>
<p>You are not required to respond to the PIER if you agree with our calculations and you will be <a href="/cra-arc/payroll/remit/index.html">remitting (paying)</a> the <strong>exact </strong>amount shown on the PIER.</p>
<h4>What if you disagree with the PIER</h4>
<p>You are required to respond to the PIER if you do not agree with our calculations. You must respond by returning the PIER with any corrected information and an explanation. The response can be sent using:</p>

<ul>
<li>MyBA or RAC </li>
<li>Fax number or the address provided on the PIER </li>
</ul>
<p>If you do not reply or make a payment in full by the reply date noted on the PIER, an automatic assessment is raised and a notice of assessment (NOA) is issued to you. The NOA will include applicable penalties or interest, or both.</p>
<p><strong>In either situation, </strong>do not send amended T4 slips. We will issue any amended slip to you. </p>
<h3 id="h_2_6">What are the payment methods</h3>
<p>If you are using MyBA, you will have a <strong>Proceed to pay </strong>option in the <strong>PIER Overview </strong>section. This will allow you to do either of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pay the PIER deficiencies in full <strong>without </strong>replying </li>
<li>Pay any remaining deficiencies <strong>after </strong>you provided a response to their PIER </li>
</ul>
<p>This payment option <strong>is not </strong>available in RAC.</p>
<h3 id="h_2_7">What if adjustments are required on T4 slips</h3>
<p>If adjustments are required on T4 slips due to a PIER review, we will prepare two copies of the <strong>amended T4 slip </strong>and forward them to you. One copy for your records and one copy to be sent to your employee.</p>
</details>





<details><summary>Discrepancy notice (PD4R) </summary>
<h3 id="h_1_0">What is a PD4R notice</h3>
<p>A PD4R notice is issued to you when there is a difference between the <strong>total remittances </strong>made in the year and the <strong>total of the reported amounts </strong>on the T4 type slips, such as the T4 and T4A. If you:</p>

<ul>
<li>remitted <strong>more </strong>than the amounts reported on the slips, you will have a <strong>credit </strong>balance on your payroll account. A credit balance is <strong>not </strong>automatically transferred to the current year or refunded to you because you may have made an error on the T4 type slips that requires amending. </li>
<li>remitted <strong>less </strong>than the amounts reported on the slips, you will have a <strong>debit </strong>balance in your payroll account. A <strong>Balance due remittance voucher </strong>is included with the PD4R notice in this situation. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h_3_1">When is a PD4R issued</h3>
<p>Any of the following issues may result in a PD4R being issued:</p>
<details><summary>Remittance errors</summary>
<p>Remittance errors can occur when:</p>

<ul>
<li>there are missing remittances or extra remittances </li>
<li>incorrect amounts are remitted </li>
</ul>
<p>If you remitted <strong>more </strong>than the required amount for the year, a refund or a transfer can be requested when responding to the notice. We will review the account to determine if you are entitled to the credit. If you are entitled, the transaction will be shown on the your next statement.</p>
<p>If you remitted <strong>less </strong>than the required amount for the year, you <strong>must </strong>make a payment as soon as possible. Penalties and interest may apply. </p>
