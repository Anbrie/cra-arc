<p>Depending on the situation, your employee may request an increase or a reduction to income tax deductions. Certain life events may also affect amounts to be withheld from payments to them.</p>

<h2 class="h3">On this page</h2>
  <ul>
<li><a href="#h-1">Individual wants to increase income tax deductions</a></li>    	  
<li><a href="#h-2">Individual wants to reduce income tax deductions</a></li>    
<li><a href="#h-3">Employer or payer wants to reduce income tax deduction (blanket waiver for $15,000 or less)</a></li>
<li><a href="#h-4">Life events that affect CPP, EI and income tax withholdings</a></li>
  
  </ul>
 
<h2 id="h-1">Individual wants to increase income tax deductions</h2>

<p>Individuals may want to increase income tax deductions to avoid having to pay a large amount of tax when they file their income tax and benefit return. For example, in the following situations, insufficient income tax may be deducted:</p>

<ul>
<li>an individual works part-time for different employers during the year </li>
<li>an individual no longer pays for child care </li>
<li>an individual's province of employment is not the same as their province of residence and they will not have enough tax deducted </li>
</ul>
<h4>How to increase</h4>
<p>To increase income tax deductions, the <strong>individual</strong> must complete <strong>revised TD1 forms</strong>.</p> 
<p>Learn more: <a href="td1.html">Get the completed TD1 forms</a></p></p>


		 
<h2 id="h-2">Individual wants to reduce income tax deductions</h2>		 

<p>There are many other deductions from income, or non-refundable tax credits that are not part of the TD1 form that may be used to reduce income tax deducted at source. These require the <strong>individual </strong>to apply for a <strong>letter of authority</strong>. A letter of authority from the CRA is required when individuals want to reduce income tax deductions in the following situations:</p>

<ul>
<li>individual makes charitable donations to registered charities or other qualified donees </li>
<li>individual has employment-related expenses </li>
<li>individual pays for child care </li>
<li>individual makes deductible RRSP contributions himself during the year </li>
<li>individual's province of employment is not the same as their province of residence and they will have too much tax deducted </li>
</ul>
<h4>How to reduce</h4>	      
<p>To reduce income tax deductions, the <strong>individual</strong> must get a </strong>letter of authority (tax waiver)</strong>. The individual must send to the CRA, either:</p>

<ul>
<li>a Form <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t1213.html">T1213</a>, Request to Reduce Tax Deductions at Source </li>
<li>a written request that supports their position why less tax should be deducted at source </li>
</ul>
<h4>After receiving the letter of authority (tax waiver) from the individual</h4>	
<p>You need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>keep the letters of authority (tax waiver) with your individual's record. <strong>Do not </strong>send us a copy. </li>
<li>reduce the income tax deducted at source by the amount specified in the letter of authority. </li>

</ul>


<h2 id="h-3">Employer or payer wants to reduce income tax deduction (blanket waiver for $15,000 or less)</h2>	

<p>You may request blanket waivers when both of the following occur:</p>

<ul>
<li>you will be making a lump-sum payment to your employees </li>
<li>you anticipate that your employees will want to contribute all or a portion of the lump-sum payment into an RRSP </li>
</ul>
<p>Blanket waivers, when applicable, eliminate the need for each employee to request a letter of authority. If approved by the CRA, you will receive a blanket waiver letter providing the details of the approval. You will also receive a <strong>declaration of intent </strong>form to be provided for each applicable employee. This form is completed by each employee and given to the employer to confirm that the employee <strong>will be </strong>contributing to an RRSP.</p>

<h3>After receiving the blanket waiver letter from the CRA</h3>
<p>When receiving the blanket waiver letter and <strong>completed </strong>declaration of intent forms, the employer or payer must:</p>

<ul>
<li>retain a copy of the blanket waiver letter and completed declaration of intent forms for their payroll records</li>
<li>reduce the lump sum payment by the amount on the declaration of intent in order to calculate the <strong>taxable </strong>amount of the lump sum payment </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h-4">Life events that affect CPP, EI and income tax withholdings</h2>
<p>You may need to determine whether you should deduct CPP contributions, EI premiums and income tax from payments you make to individuals in specific situations. For example: </p>
<ul>
<li>Individual is turning 18 </li>
<li>Individual is at least 65 years, but under 70, and provided Form CPT30, Election to Stop Contributing to the Canada Pension Plan, or Revocation of a Prior Election </li>
<li>Individual is injured during work related duties </li>
<li>Individual is disabled under the CPP </li>
<li>Individual dies </li>
<li>Individual is leaving or the contract of employment is ending </li>
</ul>
</li></>
