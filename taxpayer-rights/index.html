 <p>Accuracy and consistency are essential in the administration of tax legislation. We take a number of measures to make sure that we administer legislation in a consistent manner across the country. These measures include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
systematically analyzing the most common errors made by taxpayers and taking steps to prevent them</li>
<li>training our employees</li>
<li>issuing technical directives</li>
<li>reviewing our technical publications for accuracy</li>

<p>Generally, “service” refers to the quality and timeliness of the work we performed. A service complaint could involve having received unclear or misleading information, staff behaviour matters, mistakes, or undue delays.</p>

      <p>We recognize the need to minimize the time, effort, and costs you have to incur to comply with the tax and benefit legislation we administer. At the same time, we have a duty to protect Canada’s tax base by ensuring the highest possible level of tax compliance.</p>

<p>We believe that most individuals and businesses, given the opportunity, information, and tools, will voluntarily comply with the law. To promote this type of voluntary compliance, we try to make your dealings with us as straightforward and as convenient as possible by:</p>
<ul>
<li>offering services through multiple channels including the Internet, telephone, and mail</li>
<li>being practical in our interactions with you by reducing and simplifying, whenever possible and appropriate, the work, time, and effort you devote to preparing your taxes</li>

       <p>Service standards are the basis of our performance management system and represent our public commitment to the level of service you can expect from us under normal circumstances.</p>

 <p>We set targets for achieving each service standard based on operational realities and infrastructure, available resources, historical performance, degree of complexity of the work, and Canadians’ expectations.</p>

 <p>We regularly revise our service standards to make sure they are up-to-date and relevant. When our performance results drop significantly below targets, it is a signal to us to take action.</p>

 <p>We measure our performance against our service standards and publish the results in our departmental results report, which is tabled in Parliament every year. You can see this report by going to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/corporate-reports-information.html">CRA reports</a>.</p>

     <p>We know that to be trusted and efficient, we must conduct ourselves ethically and honestly, and the CRA strives to do so every day. Our employees are expected to act in accordance with the CRA Code of integrity and professional conduct and the Values and Ethics Code for the Public Sector.</p>
<p>These codes are terms and conditions of employment and they reinforce our commitment to serve the public with integrity, professionalism, respect, and cooperation.</p>
<p>This right means that if you&nbsp;send a service complaint or request a formal review of a CRA decision, you can be sure that the CRA will treat you impartially, and that you will receive the benefits, credits, and refunds to which you are entitled, and pay no more or no less than what is required by law. You need not fear reprisal.</p>
<p>We are required to apply the law and relevant CRA guidelines and policies, which may include the charging of penalties, or requiring the payment of your debt. When CRA employees act within the law, these actions do not constitute acts of reprisal.<span></span></p>

	<p>We believe that we can help reduce the costs small businesses incur to pay their taxes by simplifying and reducing the frequency of their interactions with us, and by improving our communications with them.

      <p>We work to make sure small businesses can interact with the CRA as quickly, simply, and effectively as possible. We continually improve our services and the various ways we make them available.</p>
<p>For example, you can now choose to receive notices of assessment and reassessment, as well as some letters online. When you register for email notifications, the CRA will no longer print and mail correspondence items to you.
