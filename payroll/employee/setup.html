<h2 id="h-2">Give the forms to your employee</h2>
 <details> <summary>Electronic TD1 Forms you created</summary>
<p>You may create a federal and/or provincial or territorial Form TD1, Personal Tax Credits Return, and have your employee send it to you electronically instead of giving paper copies of Form TD1 to your employees.</p>

<p>The following conditions must be met:</p> 
<ul><li>You can create, maintain and store the TD1 Personal Tax Credits Return forms electronically.</li>
<li>Security measures must be in place to authenticate the employee's identity because there is no written signature on the TD1 Form (for example, a password system or an employee self-service portal).</li></ul>
<p>In addition to the above conditions, the electronic forms must:</p>

<ul>
<li>be made available and accessible to the CRA when requested and be maintained in a format that can be read by representatives of the CRA. </li>
<li>mirrors the CRA approved TD1 paper form </li>
<li>include a certification confirming that the information given by the employee is accurate. For example, clicking on a button saying "I agree" to a statement that is similar to the certification statement on the paper Form TD1 return (i.e. the information is correct and complete to the best of his or her knowledge) </li>
<li>be in a format that cannot be altered. In other words changes can only be made if your employee submits a new Form TD1 </li>
<li>include a date so you can tell when your employee submits a new Form TD1 to you </li>
<li>meets all of the CRA's general guidelines on record retention and on electronic records, which can be found in information circular <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/ic78-10.html">IC78-10R, Books and Records Retention/Destruction</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>The use of the electronic form will not relieve you of your responsibility to review the completed forms for reasonableness. </p>
</details>
<details> <summary>Online TD1 Forms</summary>
<p>You can give the link to the appropriate Forms. </p>

</details>

 <h2 id="h-3">Tips for employers when providing the forms</h2>

<p>You may need to get <strong>additional information</strong> from your employee depending on the employment situation.</p>
<details>
<summary>Situation: Employee lives in one province but works in another</span></summary>
<p>If your employee lives in one province but works in another, they may be subject to excessive or insufficient tax deductions. Your employee can ask for a reduction in tax deductions by obtaining a <strong>letter of authority </strong>from any TSO or request additional tax to be withheld on their <strong>federal </strong>TD1 form.</p>
<p>Learn more: <a href="changes.html">Make changes to employee information</a>.</p>

		 </details>
<details>
<summary>Situation: Employee is a working part-time</span></summary>
<p>You may recommend to your part-time employees that it could be beneficial to have more income tax deducted from the remuneration they receive. Your employee may avoid having to pay a large amount of tax when they file their income tax and benefit return. This may happen if they work part-time for different employers during the year.</p>
		 </details>
<details>
<summary>Situation: Employee has more than one employer or payer at the same time</span></summary>
<p>If your employee has more than one employer or payer at the same time and has already claimed personal tax credit amounts on another TD1 form, the employee <strong>cannot claim them again</strong>. If the employee's total income from all sources will be <strong>more </strong>than the personal tax credits claimed on another TD1 form, he or she <strong>must check </strong>the box "More than one employer or payer at the same time" on the back of the TD1 form, enter "0" on line 13 on the front page and should not complete lines 2 to 12.</p>

		 </details>
<details>
<summary>Situation: Employee want's to reduce the amount of tax to be deducted</span></summary>
<p>You may recommend to your employee to get a letter of authority from CRA to reduce the amount of tax you will be deducting. Examples of when employees may request a reduction in tax deductions:</p>

<ul>
<li>employee makes charitable donations to registered charities or other qualified donees </li>
<li>employee has employment-related expenses </li>
<li>employee pays for child care </li>
<li>employee makes deductible RRSP contributions himself during the year </li>
<li>employee lives in one province or territory but works in another and will have too much tax deducted </li>
</ul>
<p>Learn more: <a href="changes.html">Make changes to employee information</a>.</p>		
</details>
<details>
<summary>Situation: Employee is a pensionner</span></summary>
		 </details>

<details>
<summary>Situation: Employee is a non-resident</span></summary>
		 </details>	

 <h2 id="h-4">What if you do not receive the form</h2>

<p>If an employee does not give you their Form TD1, the employee's tax deductions will only include the basic personal amount you estimated bases on their income. You still need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Determine which tax tables to use </li>
<li>Calculate deductions and remit them by the due date </li></ul>
