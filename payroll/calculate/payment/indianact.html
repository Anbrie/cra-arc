<p>For purposes of the tax exemption under section 87 of the Indian Act, the term <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/payroll/payroll-deductions-contributions/special-situations/indian-employees.html#dfntns">Indian</a> is used because it has a legal meaning in the Indian Act. Section 87 of the Indian Act exempts from taxation the personal property of an Indian situated on a reserve. The section 87 exemption only applies to an Indian as defined by the Indian Act. It does not apply to all Indigenous Peoples in Canada such as the Inuit or Métis. </p>
<p>You must report all income and deductions on a T4 or T4A slip for status Indian employees regardless of whether their income is taxable or exempt. </p>
<details><summary>Terms used on this page</summary>
<h4>Employer is resident on a reserve</h4>
<p>"Employer is resident on a reserve" means that the reserve is the place where the central management and control over the employer organization is actually located.</p>
<p>The central management and control of an organization is usually considered to be exercised by the group that performs the function of a board of directors of the organization. However, it may be that the real management and control of an organization is exercised by some other person or group. Generally, management and control is exercised at the principal place of business but it is recognized that this function may be legitimately exercised in a place other than the principal administrative office of the organization. It is a question of fact where the central management and control is exercised.</p>
<h4>Indian</h4>
<p>"Indian" means an Indian as defined for the purposes of the Indian Act.</p>
<h4>Indian lives on the reserve</h4>
<p>"Indian lives on the reserve" means the Indian lives on the reserve in a domestic establishment that is his or her principal place of residence and that is the centre of his or her daily routine.</p>
<h4>On a reserve</h4>
<p>"On a reserve" means on a reserve as defined for purposes of the Indian Act, including any settlements deemed to be reserves for purposes of the Indian Settlements Remission Order, and any other areas given similar treatment under federal legislation (for example, Category I-A lands under the Cree-Naskapi" (of Quèbec) Act).</p>
<h4>Social, cultural, educational or economic development</h4>
<p>"Social, cultural, educational or economic development" includes the provision of social services such as health care or counselling.</p>

<h2 id="h_1">Determine the status of the employee</h2>
<p>An Indian is defined in the Indian Act as an individual who is listed or is entitled to be listed in the Indian Register. The Indian Register is the official record identifying all Indians who are registered in Canada. Indigenous Services Canada is responsible for the Indian Register and is the only one authorized to issue a "certificate of Indian status" to an individual.</p>
<h3>Status situations</h3>
<details><summary>Situation: Your employee is registered as a status Indian under the Indian Act</summary>
<p>Depending on your situation, the employment income of status Indians may be exempt from tax. It is the income that is exempt from tax and not the person. </p>
<p>The rules for CPP and EI are different. EI premiums are always required and income that is exempt from income tax is not pensionable employment although you or the employee may elect into the plan.</p>
<p>To determine if the income is exempt from tax in this situation, continue to: <a href="#h_2">Determine the residency of the employee or employer</a>.</p>
</details>
		 
<details><summary>Situation: Your employee is a treaty beneficiary of a First Nation with a final or self-government agreement that ends the tax exemption under section 87 of the Indian Act</summary>
<p>The employment income is taxable if your employee is a treaty beneficiary of a First Nation with a final or <a href="https://www.rcaanc-cirnac.gc.ca/eng/1100100032275/1529354547314">self-government</a> agreement that ends the tax exemption under section 87 of the Indian Act.</p>
<p>You need to deduct CPP, EI and income tax in this situation, same as your regular employees.</p>

<h4>Learn more</h4>
<p>Some First Nations have signed an agreement with the government of Canada to become self-governing Nations. As a result, even though they have Indian status, their members <strong>gave up their tax exemption </strong>provided by section 87 of the Indian Act.</p>
<ul>
<li>Members of such First Nations are usually taxed on their income in the same manner as other Canadians. </li>
<li>They are asked to identify themselves on the first page of their tax return as residing on a settlement land of an Aboriginal government at the end of the year. They are also asked to confirm whether they are citizens or members of these Indigenous governments. Such details are necessary when part of their federal, provincial or territorial tax is transferred to their Indigenous government in accordance with the agreement.  </li>
</ul>

</details>

<details><summary>Situation: Your employee is not registered as a status Indian under the Indian Act</summary>
<p>The employment income is taxable if your employee is not registered as a status Indian under the Indian Act. The section 87 exemption <strong>only applies to an Indian as defined by the Indian Act</strong>.</p>
<p>You need to deduct CPP, EI and income tax for this situation, same as your regular employees.</p>
</details>

<h2 id="h_2">Determine the residency of the employee or employer</h2>

<h3 id="h_2_1">Residency situations</h3>

<details><summary>Situation: Employee lives on a reserve and employer is resident on a reserve </summary>
<p>The employment income is <strong>exempt </strong>if your <strong>employee lives on a reserve </strong>and <strong>you are resident on a reserve. </strong>This includes employment-related income such as unemployment benefits, retiring allowances, and other pensions.</p>
<p>Generally, you <strong>do not </strong>deduct CPP, EI and income tax in this situation.</p>
<h3 id="h_0_1">More information</h3>
<p>Under the CRA's administrative policy, the individual's income qualifies for the exemption under section 87 of the Indian Act of the Indian Act because <strong>all </strong>of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>employee is registered as a status Indian under the Indian Act </li>
<li>employee is <strong>not </strong>a treaty beneficiary of a First Nation with a final or self-government agreement that ends the tax exemption under section 87 of the Indian Act </li>
<li>employee lives on a reserve, this means it is their principal place of residence and is the centre of their daily routine </li>
<li>employer is a resident on a reserve, this means the reserve is the place where the central management and control over the employer organization is actually located </li>
</ul>
<details><summary>Examples of where exempt and not exempt</summary>
<h4>Examples where exempt</h4>
<p>Mrs. H works for a logging company that is resident on a reserve. Mrs. H lives on a reserve, but performs the duties at lumber camps located off the reserve. The employment income is exempt from income tax because the place where the employee lives and the residence of their employer are factors connecting the income to a reserve.</p>
<p>Mr. I is a construction worker employed by a construction company that is resident on a reserve, to work on building sites that are not located on a reserve. Mr. I lives on a reserve, except for short periods each year when he lives near the construction sites. When away from the reserve, he retains his residence on the reserve where his family lives. Mr. I is exempt from income tax on his employment income because the place where he lives and the residence of his employer are factors connecting his employment income to a reserve.</p>
<h4>Examples where not exempt</h4>
<p>Ms. J lives on a reserve and works as an accountant at the head office of a bank located off a reserve in a nearby city. The bank maintains a branch on Ms. J's reserve and arranges for her to be paid at that branch. Ms. J's employment income is taxable because the only substantive factor linking her employment income to a reserve is her residence which, without other substantial connecting factors, does not result in exemption. Payment on the reserve is viewed as a connecting factor of relatively little weight.</p>
<p>Mr. K is a construction worker employed by a corporation situated on a reserve. The corporation is an employment agency that makes employees available to work for clients that are not situated on a reserve, on building sites not located on a reserve. Mr. K lives on a reserve. The employment agency had an office on the reserve, but carried out very few of its business activities on the reserve. The guidelines would not apply in this case, and one must therefore do an analysis of the connecting factors. Mr. K's employment income is taxable because the residence of the employer in this case has little weight as a connecting factor. The only other substantive factor connecting Mr. K's employment income to a reserve is his residence, which is not sufficient to bring the employment income within the exemption.</p>
<p>Ms. B lives on a reserve and works as director general on that reserve for their corporation (of which they are a shareholder). Their administrative offices are located on that reserve but whose work is carried on mostly off a reserve. Ms. B receives a salary from their corporation. This salary is exempt. Ms. B pays themselves a bonus on top of their salary which bonus is based on the company's performance. The connecting factor of the bonus is not sufficient to bring that income within the exemption.</p>
</details>

<p>Where an employee is a shareholder who controls the business (non-arm's length with the corporation), the source of the business income may be relevant in determining whether the s.87 tax exemption applies to the income received in their capacity as an employee. Where the source of the business income in this situation is off the reserve, the employment income (salary and bonuses) will not be considered to be connected to the reserve and will not be exempt from tax. </p>
