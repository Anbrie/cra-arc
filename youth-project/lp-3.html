  <h2 id="h-1">Overview</h2>
  <p>This lesson will introduce students to the Canadian income tax and benefit return, known as the tax return, and will walk them through its basic steps. This will help clarify the calculations done by certified tax software so students can better understand the final result of their taxes. Students will be able to test their knowledge through quizzes and practical examples.</p>
  <p>The <strong>core question </strong>is:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>How is a tax return completed?</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Learning objective:</strong> Students will develop an understanding of the steps of the tax return. As a result, they will be better equipped to do their own taxes and to make sense of the calculations done by certified tax software. </p>
  <p>The <strong>time frame</strong> to complete this lesson is X.</p>
  <h2 id="h-2">Skills to develop</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Identify the basic steps of the tax return</li>
    <li>Describe what identification information to include</li>
    <li>Explain what types of income to report</li>
    <li>Differentiate between deductions, non-refundable tax credits, and refundable tax credits</li>
	<li>Describe how to calculate tax on their income</li>
	  <li>Explain how to calculate a refund or a balance owing</li>
	  <li>Make connections between examples given and their own personal tax situation</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="h-3">Background</h2>
<p>In Canada, individuals fill out a tax return every year to report the income they earned or received during the year. They use the tax return to calculate if they have a balance owing or if they are entitled to a refund. This process ensures that each individual pays the correct amount of tax.</p>
	
	
<p>Generally, the individual or company that pays you income will withhold tax at source, for example, your employer will deduct tax from your pay. The tax deducted over the course of the year helps cover the taxes you owe on your income at the end of the year.</p>
	
	
<p>An individual must do their taxes if they want to claim a refund or receive any benefits and credits from the government they might be entitled to.</p>

      <h3 id="h-4-2">Warm up exercises<span class="wb-inv"> step 2</span></h3>
      <h4>First exercise</h4>
      <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Explain to students that taxpayers in Canada do their taxes every year to calculate if they owe taxes (they have to pay the government) or if they are entitled to receive a tax refund (the government pays them). </p>
      <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Ask students if they have ever done their own taxes or if they have seen their parents or legal guardians do theirs. For those who have, ask what they remember about the process. Give them a few moments to share their experience.</p>
	 <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Reassure students (particularly those who have had a negative experience, have been confused, or have had difficulties) that doing their taxes can be easy, especially once they understand the basic process.</p>
		
		
		
		
		
      
      <h4>Second exercise</h4>
      <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Inform students that the fastest and easiest way to do their taxes is electronically using certified tax software. There are many certified tax software they can choose from to do their taxes, some of which are free, and each is a bit different.</p>
      <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Advise students that most software will:</p>
		
		<ul>
		<li>have them answer some questions about their tax situation</li>
		<li>ask them to input their personal and tax information</li>
		<li>complete the calculations and appropriate forms for them</li>
		
		</ul>
		
		
		<p>However, they are responsible for ensuring the tax return they submit is correct, so it’s important for them to understand the steps involved. </p>
		
		
  <h4>Third exercise</h4>
      <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Ask students if they have ever filled out a government form before. For those who have, ask them to list some of the common elements they must provide on a form, such as their full name, address, and date of birth. Advise students that some forms may request additional information, depending on the type of form and the individual’s circumstances.</p>
      <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Discuss how the tax return compares to other government forms. The tax return has a basic structure to complete and individuals will fill out different sections based on their personal situation. </p>		
		
   
    
    </div>
    <div class="lst-stps-itm">
      <h3 id="h-4-3">Walk through the lessons<span class="wb-inv"> step 3</span></h3>
      <p>Read  through the lesson pages with the additional guidance provided below. Students  can review material individually, in groups, or as a class.</p>
      <h4>Lesson A: Basics of a tax return</h4>
      <h5>Before starting the lesson</h5>
      <p>Review the outline of each step of the tax return and point out the connections between them. For example, the total income calculated in step 2 is used as the starting point for step 3, and the taxes calculated in steps 5 and 6 are a part of the total payable in step 7.</p>
		
	<div class="well brdr-rds-0">
        <h5 class="mrgn-tp-0">Activity</h5>
        <p>Have students stop and watch <strong>The one about doing your taxes </strong>video in section x of the lesson . Give the students a few minutes to take note of the keywords and concepts shown in the video. Ask them to keep these in mind as they review the next pages. </p>
      </div>	
		
      <h5>After finishing the lesson</h5>
      <p>Stress to students that if they choose to file electronically, the certified tax software may not go through the tax return step-by-step.</p>
      <h4>Lesson B: Providing your personal information</h4>
      <h5>Before starting the lesson</h5>
      <p>Explain to students that their personal information is important because it ensures that their taxes, benefits, and credits are calculated accurately.</p>
		
		<p>Discuss with students what could happen if they report an incorrect social insurance number, name, or address. Indicate that this could cause processing delays or calculation errors. </p>
  
      
      <h4>Lesson C: Reporting your income</h4>
      <h5>Before starting the lesson</h5>
      <p>Ask students what types of income they have received and whether or not they think it needs to be reported on their tax return.</p>
      <p>Highlight the importance of reporting all types of income, including tips received as cash and income from the platform economy. If they don’t, they could face penalties, interest, and fines. </p>
    
      <h4>Lesson D: Claiming your deductions</h4>
      <h5>Before starting the lesson</h5>
      <p>Explain to students that although they claim different deductions in steps 3 and 4 of the tax return, all these deductions reduce their taxable income and, therefore, the tax they may owe on their income. Reducing the taxes they may owe could make them eligible for a refund or increase the amount of their refund.</p>
		
		<p>Review what deductions are available, using either the common examples given in the module or the deduction lines in steps 3 and 4 of the tax return. Ask students which deductions might apply to them or to people they know, such as their parents or legal guardians.</p>
		
		
    </div>
	  
	  <h4>Lesson E: Claiming your non-refundable tax credits</h4>
      <h5>Before starting the lesson</h5>
      <p>Explain to students that although they claim different deductions in steps 3 and 4 of the tax return, all these deductions reduce their taxable income and, therefore, the tax they may owe on their income. Reducing the taxes they may owe could make them eligible for a refund or increase the amount of their refund.</p>
	  
	  <p>Compare non-refundable tax credits to a coupon. Using a coupon at the store reduces the amount you have to pay, but any remaining amount cannot be refunded to you. </p>
		
		<p>Review what deductions are available, using either the common examples given in the module or the deduction lines in steps 3 and 4 of the tax return. Ask students which deductions might apply to them or to people they know, such as their parents or legal guardians.</p>
	  
	  <p>The way they claim non-refundable tax credits varies:</p>
	  
	  <ul>
	  <li>some are automatically calculated (such as the basic personal amount)</li>
	  <li>some are based on documents the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) has access to (such as their CPP/QPP contributions or EI premiums on a T4 slip)</li>
	  <li>some require supporting documents (such as receipts for their medical expenses)</li>
	  </ul>
	  
	  <div class="well brdr-rds-0">
        <h5 class="mrgn-tp-0">Activity</h5>
        <p>Look through the guide for your province or territory  to see which non-refundable tax credits are available. Ask the students to identify a situation where they may qualify for one of the provincial or territorial tax credits.  </p>
      </div>
	  
	    <h4>Lesson F: Calculating your taxes</h4>
      <h5>Before starting the lesson</h5>
	  <p>Point out that students will need to use the taxable income  from step 4 of the tax return to calculate their tax payable.</p>
	  
	  <p>Explain to students that Canada has a progressive tax system, which means you pay more tax as your income increases. However, each higher tax rate  applies only to the income within that particular tax bracket . The higher tax rate does not apply to all of the total taxable income.</p>
	  
	  <p>Clarify that tax payable is calculated in two different steps of the tax return: federal tax in step 5 and provincial or territorial tax in step 6. If students choose to do their taxes using certified tax software, the software will complete these calculations automatically for them.</p>
	  
	  <p>Remind them that residents of Quebec will calculate their provincial tax payable separately through Revenu Québec.</p>
	  
	  <p>Advise students that the non-refundable tax credits reviewed on the previous page are calculated in these steps. </p>
	  
	  <h4>Lesson G: Finding out if you get a refund or owe tax</h4>
      <h5>Before starting the lesson</h5>
	  <p>Explain to students that step 7 ultimately determines if they are entitled to receive a tax refund or if they will have an amount to pay to the CRA.</p>
	  
	    <p>Discuss income tax deductions with the students since many of them may be entering the workforce over the next few years. Advise them that their employer will ideally withhold enough income tax from their pay to cover their tax debt at the end of the year. Their employer will base the tax deductions on their income and the tax information they provide their employer. They provide this information on a TD1, Personal Tax Credits Return.</p>
	  
	    <p>Talk about how two individuals with identical information slips may have different results on their tax return. For example, if one individual is able to reduce their tax payable by claiming a deduction for child care expenses and a non-refundable tax credit for an eligible dependant, they may receive a larger tax refund. </p>
	  
    <div class="lst-stps-itm">
      <h3 id="h-4-4">Bring it all together<span class="wb-inv"> step 4</span></h3>
      <p>Direct  students to complete the quiz to assess their understanding. </p>
      <p>Have students review the keywords and concepts they wrote down during <strong>The one about doing your taxes</strong> video. Ask them to think about the connections between the terms, and to add any new ones they may have learned during the module. </p>
		
	  <p>Ask the students to compare the different elements involved in a tax return and to think about how these can affect their tax calculations.</p>
      <p>Some of these elements are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>income levels</li>
		   <li>deductions</li>
		   <li>non-refundable tax credits</li>
		   <li>province or territory of residence</li>
		   <li>refundable tax credits</li>
	    <li>eligibility requirements</li>
      </ul>
		
		
<div class="well brdr-rds-0">
        <h5 class="mrgn-tp-0">Activity</h5>
        <p>Review the module exercise, a simplified version of an income tax and benefit return for Jonah Smith, with the students. Go over each step of the calculation with the class and discuss where and why these amounts are reported or claimed in the various steps. Emphasize the amounts shown are not actual tax brackets, tax rates or credit values. Have the students complete the exercise for Terry Lee have them compare their answers with each other. Review the answer key with the students. </p>
      </div>
		
		<p>Remind students that it is important to review any tax return prepared with certified tax software since they are responsible for what they submit to the CRA. </p>
		
		<p>Encourage students to go through each step of their tax return to ensure that:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>they entered all their information correctly </li>
		<li>the software completed all the calculations</li>
		<li>they did not forget to claim any credits they might be entitled to</li>
		
		</ul>
		
		
		
		
		
		
      <p>Reassure students that they can correct any mistakes they may make when doing their taxes by contacting the CRA. </p>
