<h2 id="h-2">Electronic or paper TD1 forms</h2>
 <details> <summary>Electronic TD1 forms you created</summary>
<p>You may create a federal and/or provincial or territorial Form TD1, Personal Tax Credits Return, and have the individual send it to you electronically instead of giving paper copies of Form TD1 to the individual.</p>

<p>The following conditions must be met:</p> 
<ul><li>You can create, maintain and store the TD1 Personal Tax Credits Return forms electronically.</li>
<li>Security measures must be in place to authenticate the individual's identity because there is no written signature on the TD1 Form (for example, a password system or an individual self-service portal).</li></ul>
<p>In addition to the above conditions, the electronic forms must:</p>

<ul>
<li>be made available and accessible to the CRA when requested and be maintained in a format that can be read by representatives of the CRA. </li>
<li>mirrors the CRA approved TD1 paper form </li>
<li>include a certification confirming that the information given by the individual is accurate. For example, clicking on a button saying "I agree" to a statement that is similar to the certification statement on the paper Form TD1 return (i.e. the information is correct and complete to the best of his or her knowledge) </li>
<li>be in a format that cannot be altered. In other words changes can only be made if the individual submits a new Form TD1 </li>
<li>include a date so you can tell when the individual submits a new Form TD1 to you </li>
<li>meets all of the CRA's general guidelines on record retention and on electronic records, which can be found in information circular <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/ic78-10.html">IC78-10R, Books and Records Retention/Destruction</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>The use of the electronic form will not relieve you of your responsibility to review the completed forms for reasonableness. </p>
</details>
<details> <summary>Online or paper TD1 forms</summary>
<p>You can give the link to the webpage or give paper copies of the appropriate TD1 forms to the individual. </p>
</details>

 

 <h2 id="h-4">What if you do not receive the form</h2>

<p>If an individual does not give the completed Form TD1, the individual's tax deductions will only include the basic personal amount you estimated based on their income. You still need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>determine which tax tables to use </li>
<li>calculate deductions and remit them by the due date </li></ul>
<h3>Penalties</h3>
<p>If the individual does provide you with a form, they may be penalized $25 for each day the form is late. The minimum penalty is $100, and increases by $25 per day to the maximum of $2,500.</p>


<h2 id="h-5">After receiving the forms</h2>
<p>You need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>review the back of the TD1 form to make sure the individual has not included any <strong>additional </strong>information (for example, requesting additional tax to be deducted). </li>
<li>review the back of the TD1 form to make sure the box <strong>More than one employer or payer at the same time </strong>is not checked. If the box is checked and the individuals' total income from all sources will be <strong>more </strong>than the personal tax credits claimed on another TD1 form, you must enter <strong>zero </strong>on the <strong>Total Claim Amount </strong>line. This is because individuals with multiple employers cannot claim the basic personal amount with more than <strong>one </strong>employer <strong>unless </strong>their combined annual earnings will be <strong>less </strong>than the basic personal amount </li>
<li>use the <strong>Total Claim Amount </strong>from the TD1 form to calculate the correct amount of federal and provincial or territorial income tax deductions </li>
<li>keep the completed forms with the individual's records. <strong>Do not </strong>send us a copy. </li>
<li>determine which tax tables to use </li>
<li>calculate deductions and remit them by the due date </li>
</ul>

<p>A new form will be required within <strong>seven days </strong>of any changes to the individual's personal tax credits. </p>
<p>Learn more on what to do when an individual wants to increase or reduce income tax deductions, and what to do if an individual's life situation changes their personal tax credits: <a href="changes.html">Make changes to employee information</a></p>


<h3>Your responsibility</h3>
<p>It is a serious offence to knowingly accept a TD1 that contains false or deceptive statements. If you think that the TD1 has false information, you should ask for proof from the individual such as proof of age and/or address If you think that the TD1 has false information, you must deduct taxes after allowing the basic personal amount <strong>only</strong>.</p>
