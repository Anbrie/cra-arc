<h1 property="name" id="wb-cont" class="gc-thickline">Calculations of bonuses or retroactive payments</h1>
<p>In addition to the regular types of payments such as salary, wages, etc., you may pay employees other types of payments. For example: </p>

<ul>
<li>Bonus (can be paid at any time but are usually paid at the end of a fiscal or calendar year)</li>
<li>Retroactive pay (are normally paid when a new contract has been finalized and there is a backdated increase in pay)</li>
<li>Other types of irregular payments </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h_1">When to use the bonus method</h2>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
  <li class="cnjnctn-col">
    <h4 class="mrgn-tp-sm text-muted h4">Use the bonus method</h4>
      <p>If the payment is made <strong>separately </strong>from regular pay, use the bonus method to calculate manually</p>

  </li>
  <li class="cnjnctn-col">
    <h4 class="mrgn-tp-sm text-muted h4">Do not use the bonus method</h4>
  <p>If the payment is made <strong>with </strong>regular pay, use: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-businesses/payroll-deductions-online-calculator.html?utm_campaign=not-applicable&amp;utm_medium=vanity-url&amp;utm_source=canada-ca_pdoc">Payroll Deductions Online Calculator (PDOC)</a> or <a href="tables.html">CPP, EI and income tax deductions tables</a></p>
 
  </li>
</ul>


<h2 id="h_2">Why use this bonus method</h2>
<p>This method will result in a tax deduction that better estimates the amount of tax the individual will owe on the employment income when filing their personal income tax return. Using the bonus method provides a fairer tax deduction because the payment is spread over the year and taxed accordingly.</p>

<ol class="lst-stps stps-strpd">

<li><p>You need to calculate the total remuneration for the year, including the bonus or increase, and remove the following amounts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deduction for living in a prescribed zone </li>
<li>Amount that a tax services office or a court order has authorized </li>
<li>Registered pension plan (RPP) contributions </li>
<li>Union dues </li>
<li>Employee's contributions to a retirement compensation arrangement (RCA) or certain pension plans </li>
<li>Contributions to a registered retirement savings plan (RRSP) provided you have reasonable grounds to believe the contribution can be deducted by the employee for the year </li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>If the result of this calculation is:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
  <li class="cnjnctn-col">
    <h4 class="mrgn-tp-sm text-muted h4">$5,000 or less</h4>
      <p>Deduct 15% federal tax (if applicable, 10% in Quebec) from the bonus or retroactive pay increase </p>

  </li>
  <li class="cnjnctn-col">
    <h4 class="mrgn-tp-sm text-muted h4">More than $5,000</h4>
  <p>The amount you need to deduct depends on whether the bonus is paid once a year or more than once a year</a></p>
 
  </li>
</ul>

<details><summary>Example 1 &ndash; First or once-a-year bonus payment</summary>
<p>Donna earns a salary of $400 per week. In September, you gave her a bonus of $300. Her province of employment is British Columbia. The claim code that applies to her TD1 and TD1BC forms is "1."</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Divide the bonus by the number of pay periods in the year ($300 ÷ 52 = $5.77).</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Add the $5.77 to the current pay rate of $400. As a result, the adjusted pay rate for the year is $405.77 per week.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: </strong>In <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/payroll/t4032-payroll-deductions-tables.html">Guide T4032, Payroll Deductions Tables</a>, choose the weekly tables (52 pay periods a year) from Sections D and E to find the increased weekly federal and provincial tax you should deduct on the additional $5.77 per week.</p>
<p><strong>Calculate as follows:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Find the federal and provincial tax that you deduct on $405.77 per week. </li>
<li>Subtract the federal and provincial tax that you deduct on $400 per week. </li>
</ul>
<p>The result is the tax you have to deduct on the additional $5.77 per week.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: </strong>Multiply the additional tax you deduct per week by 52 (the number of pay periods in the year). This gives you the amount of income tax to deduct from the bonus of $300.</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Example 2 &ndash; More than one bonus payment a year</summary>
<p>Mario earns a salary of $400 per week (<strong>amount 1</strong>). You paid him bonuses of $300 in January and $780 in February. His province of employment is Alberta. The claim code that applies to his TD1 and TD1AB forms is "1."</p>
<p>The calculation must take into account <strong>all </strong>bonuses you paid during the year. You have to calculate the amount of tax to deduct for the entire year, regardless of when you paid the bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Divide the bonus you paid in January by the number of pay periods in the year ($300 ÷ 52 = $5.77) (<strong>amount 2</strong>). Add the $5.77 to the weekly salary of $400 to determine the adjusted weekly pay before the February bonus ($400 + $5.77 = $405.77).</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Divide the <strong>last </strong>bonus you paid to Mario by the number of pay periods in the year ($780 ÷ 52 = $15) (<strong>amount 3</strong>). Add amounts 1, 2, and 3 to determine the adjusted weekly pay for the year of $420.77 ($400 + $5.77 + $15).</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: </strong>In <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/payroll/t4032-payroll-deductions-tables.html">Guide T4032, Payroll Deductions Tables</a>, choose the weekly tables (52 pay periods a year) from Sections D and E to find the increased weekly federal and provincial tax you should deduct on the additional $15 per week.</p>
<p><strong>Calculate as follows:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Find the federal and provincial tax that you deduct on $420.77 per week. </li>
<li>Subtract the federal and provincial tax that you deduct on $405.77 per week. </li>
</ul>
<p>The result is the tax you have to deduct on the additional $15.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: </strong>Multiply the additional tax per week by 52 to determine the amount to deduct on the bonus of $780.</p>
<p>To calculate tax on additional bonuses, <strong>repeat steps 1 to 4</strong>.</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Example 3 &ndash; Retroactive pay increase</summary>
<p>Irene's pay increased from $440 to $460 per week. The increase was retroactive to 12 weeks, which gives her a total retroactive payment of $240 (12 × $20). Her province of employment is Nova Scotia. The claim code that applies to her TD1 and TD1NS forms is "6."</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: </strong>In <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/payroll/t4032-payroll-deductions-tables.html">Guide T4032, Payroll Deductions Tables</a>, choose the weekly tables (52 pay periods a year) from Sections D and E to find the increase in the weekly federal and provincial tax that you should deduct because of the increased pay rate.</p>
<p><strong>Calculate as follows:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Find the federal and provincial tax that you deduct on $460 per week. </li>
<li>Subtract the federal and provincial tax that you deduct on $440 per week. </li>
</ul>
<p>The result is the tax you have to deduct on the additional $20 per week.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Multiply the increase in the weekly tax that you deduct by the number of weeks to which the retroactive pay increase applies. This amount is the tax that you must deduct from the retroactive payment.</p>
