        <p>You can request a change to your tax return by amending the amount entered on specific line(s) of your return.<strong> Do not file another return for that year, unless the return you want to amend was a <span class="nowrap">152(7) factual assessment</span>.</strong></p>
<p>Wait until you receive your notice of assessment before asking for changes to your return.</p>
<p>Generally you can only request a change to a return for a tax year ending in any of the <span class="nowrap">10 previous</span> calendar years. For example, a request made <span class="nowrap">in 2022</span> must relate to <span class="nowrap">the 2012</span> or a later tax year to be considered.</p>

<h3>My Account&nbsp;</h3>
<p>My Account is a secure portal that lets you view your personal income tax and benefit information and manage your tax affairs online.</p>
<h3>Change my return</h3>
<p>Change my return (CMR) is a secure <a href="account-individuals.html">My Account</a> service that allows you to make an online adjustment for the <span class="nowrap">10 previous</span> calendar years.</p>

<li>a tax return where <span class="nowrap">9 reassessments</span> exist for a particular tax year</li>
<li>a bankruptcy return</li>
<li>a return prior to the year of bankruptcy</li>
<li>carryback amounts such as capital or<span class="nowrap"> non-capital</span> losses</li>
<li>a return of an international or non-resident client (including deemed residents of Canada, newcomers to Canada, and individuals who left Canada during the year)</li>
<li>the elected split-pension amount</li>
<li>a return where you have income from a business with a permanent establishment outside your province or territory of residence (you have to complete <span class="nowrap">Form T2203</span>, Provincial and Territorial Taxes for Multiple Jurisdictions)</li>
<li>a return that was filed by the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> under s<span class="nowrap">ubsection 152(7)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>In any of these cases, go to <a href="#bymail">By mail</a>.</p>
<h3>ReFILE</h3>
<p>To use ReFILE, your tax return must have been filed electronically.</p>
<p>Individuals (<a href="certified-software-netfile-program.html">NETFILE</a> users) can use ReFILE to send adjustments&nbsp;for 2021, 2020, 2019 and 2018 returns.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://apps.cra-arc.gc.ca/ebci/efes/epcs/pub/PostalCodeSearch-e">EFILE service providers</a>&nbsp;can send adjustments for&nbsp;2021, 2020, 2019 and 2018 returns.

<p>For more information about this service, go to <a href="refile-online-t1-adjustments-efile-service-providers.html">ReFILE</a>.</p>
<p>After you have made online changes to your tax return, keep all your receipts and supporting documents in case the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> asks to see them. Provide supporting documents only if asked to do so and using the method of submission as indicated in the CRA's contact letter.</p>
<h2 id="bymail">By mail</h2>
<p><strong>Due to <span class="nowrap">COVID-19</span>, expect delays of 10 to 12 weeks on processing paper <span class="nowrap">T1 adjustments</span>.</strong></p>
<p>For faster service you can submit your requests for changes electronically, using Change My Return in&nbsp;<a href="account-individuals.html" target="_blank">My Account</a> or <a href="refile-online-t1-adjustments-efile-service-providers.html" target="_blank">ReFILE</a>.</p>
<p>Send both of the following to your <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information/where-mail-your-paper-t1-return.html">tax centre</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>a completed <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t1-adj.html"><span class="nowrap">Form T1-ADJ, T1 Adjustment Request</span></a></li>
<li><strong>all</strong> supporting documents for the change, including those for the original assessment, unless you have already sent them to the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr></li>

        <p>Send your current year return <strong>separately</strong> from any request to change a return for another year.</p>
<h2>Processing time</h2>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>'s goal is to send you a notice of reassessment, or a letter explaining why the CRA did not make the changes you asked for, as well as any refund within:</p>
<ul>
<li>two weeks, when you request an adjustment online</li>
<li>eight weeks, when you file a paper adjustment request</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information, go to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/service-standards-cra/service-standards-2019-20.html">Service Standards in the CRA</a>.<br><br>
Processing timeframes apply to routine adjustment requests. Some change requests are considered complex and will take longer to process due to the additional verification required. They include situations where:</p>
<ul>
<li>the CRA has to contact you or your authorized representative for more information or documentation</li>
<li>your request is to adjust multiple tax returns, or tax years beyond the normal <span class="nowrap">3 year</span> reassessment period</li>
<li>your request is for a bankruptcy return</li>
<li>your request is related to a deceased taxpayer</li>
<li>you request a carryback amount such as capital or <span class="nowrap">non-capital</span> losses</li>
<li>your request is related to an international or non-resident client</li>
<li>your request is for the elected <span class="nowrap">split-pension</span> amount</li>
</ul>
<p>The CRA wants to assure you that processing your request is our highest priority. The time required to complete a complex adjustment request varies with the type of adjustment and the circumstances involved. The CRA continually strives to find the right balance between processing timeliness and the need to protect the integrity of our<span class="nowrap"> self-assessment </span>tax system.</p>
<h2>When the review is done the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> will send you one of the following:</h2>
<ul>
<li>a notice of reassessment showing any changes to your return</li>
<li>a letter explaining why the CRA did not make the changes you asked for or if no changes were needed</li>
</ul>
<p>To change your address, go to <a href="change-your-address.html">Update your CRA information: Change your address</a>.</p>
