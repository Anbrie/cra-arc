<p>Once you have registered for the GST/HST, you are required to begin charging and collecting the tax on the taxable supplies that you make in Canada. The rate of tax that you are required to charge and collect on those supplies is based on the place of supply that determines whether a supply is made in Canada, and the province in which a supply is made. </p>

<h2 id="h_1">What types of supplies are taxed</h2>
			 
			 <p>You have to charge and collect tax on specified supplies that are generally taxable supplies of intangible personal property or services <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/digital-economy/digital-economy-gsthst/digital-economy-definitions.html">that you make to specified Canadian recipients</a>. Specified supplies include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>online subscription-based video or music streaming </li>
<li>mobile apps </li>
<li>E-books </li>
<li>online video gaming </li>
<li>traditional services such as legal and accounting services </li>
</ul>
<p>There are several types of supplies that would <strong>not </strong>be considered to be specified supplies, including: </p>

<ul>
<li>supplies that may not be consumed or used in Canada, </li>
<li>supplies that relate to tangible personal property or real property that is situated outside Canada, and </li>
<li>services that are supplied to a person in connection with a supply of short-term accommodation made to the person, and the consideration for which represents a booking fee, administration fee or other similar charge. </li>
</ul>
			 <p>A specified Canadian recipient would include a Canadian consumer and a Canadian entity who is not registered under the normal GST/HST regime. It is a recipient of a supply who:</p>
			 <ul>
				 <li>has a usual place of residence that is situated in Canada, and </li>
				 <li>who has not provided to the supplier or <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/digital-economy/digital-economy-gsthst/digital-economy-definitions.html">distribution platform operator</a> satisfactory evidence that the recipient is registered under the normal GST/HST registration regime. </li>
			 </ul>
			 <h3>Special place of supply regime for digital products and services </h3>
			 
			 <p>Under the simplified GST/HST, there are special place of supply regime that determine whether the digital products and services that you supply are made in Canada, and whether they are made in a participating province. </p>
			 <ul>
				 <li>A specified supply would be considered to be made in <strong>Canada</strong> if the supply is made to a specified Canadian recipient</li>
				 <ul>
					 <li>GST at the rate of 5% would be required to be charged and collected on the supply in this case</li>
				 </ul>
				 <li>A specified supply would be considered to be made in a <strong>participating province</strong> if the supply is made to a specified Canadian recipient and the usual place of residence of the recipient in situated in the participating province.</li>
				 <ul>
					 <li>HST at the harmonized rate for the participating province would be required to be charged and collected on the supply in this case. </li>
				 </ul>
				 <li>If the usual place of residence of the specified Canadian is not situated in a participating province, the supply would be considered made in a non-participating province.  </li>
			 </ul>
			 
			 <p>As an exception, specified supplies of intangible personal property, or services, that relate to real property, would be subject to the normal GST/HST place-of-supply regime.</p>
			 

</ul>
<h2 id="h_2">Who charges and collects GST/HST</h2>
<p>The person who is required to charge and collect GST/HST on <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/digital-economy/digital-economy-gsthst/digital-economy-definitions.html#h_17">specified supplies</a> made to <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/digital-economy/digital-economy-gsthst/digital-economy-definitions.html">specified Canadian recipients</a>  under the proposed measure can be affected by if:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>those supplies are made directly to those recipients or through a distribution platform, and </li>
		<li>the supplier is registered under the simplified GST/HST registration or under the normal GST/HST registration regime.</li>
	</ul>
<h3>Specified non-resident suppliers</h3>	
	<p>If you are a specified non-resident supplier who supplies digital products and services to <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/digital-economy/digital-economy-gsthst/digital-economy-definitions.html">specified Canadian recipients</a> and you become registered under the simplified GST/HSST registration regime, whether you are required to charge and collect GST/HST on those supplies will depend on whether you make those supplies directly to those consumers or whether those supplies are made through a distribution platform. </p>
	<p>You would be required to charge and collect GST/HST on the digital supplies that you make <strong>directly</strong> to Canadian consumers. <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/digital-economy/digital-economy-gsthst/digital-economy-definitions.html">The distribution platform operator</a> would be required to charge and collect GST/HST on the supplies facilitated <strong>through the platform</strong>. </p>
	
	<p>If you are a specified non-resident supplier who makes digital supplies to <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/digital-economy/digital-economy-gsthst/digital-economy-definitions.html">specified Canadian recipients</a> and you become registered under the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/gst-hst-businesses.html">normal GST/HST registration regime</a>, you would be required to charge and collect GST/HST on those supplies, regardless of whether they are made through a <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/digital-economy/digital-economy-gsthst/digital-economy-definitions.html">distribution platform operator</a>. You would also be required to charge and collect tax on all of your supplies, including digital supplies to <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/digital-economy/digital-economy-gsthst/digital-economy-definitions.html">specified Canadian recipients</a>, that are considered to be made in Canada under the normal place of supply regime. </p>
	<h3>Distribution platform operators</h3>
	<p>If you are a <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/digital-economy/digital-economy-gsthst/digital-economy-definitions.html">distribution platform operator</a> who is registered for GST/HST under the simplified GST/HST registration regime or the normal GST/HST registration regime, you would be required to charge and collect GST/HST on the digital supplies made through your <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/digital-economy/digital-economy-gsthst/digital-economy-definitions.html">specified distribution platform</a> to <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/digital-economy/digital-economy-gsthst/digital-economy-definitions.html">specified Canadian recipients</a> by non-resident vendors who are not registered under the normal GST/HST registration regime (including those registered under the simplified GST/HST registration regime). </p>
	<p>You would not be required to charge and collect GST/HST on the services that you supply to those non-resident vendors in relation to the digital supplies.  You would also be required to charge and collect GST/HST on any digital supplies that you make <strong>directly</strong> to Canadian consumers. </p>
	<p>You would <strong>not</strong> be required to charge and collect GST/HST on the digital supplies made through your platform to <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/digital-economy/digital-economy-gsthst/digital-economy-definitions.html">specified Canadian recipients</a> by non-resident vendors who are registered under the normal GST/HST registration regime.  In this instance, the non-resident vendors who are registered under the normal GST/HST registration regime would be required to charge and collect GST/HST on these supplies.</p>
	<p>A <a href=" https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/digital-economy/digital-economy-gsthst/digital-economy-definitions.html">distribution platform operator</a> in respect of a supply of property or a service made through a <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/digital-economy/digital-economy-gsthst/digital-economy-definitions.html#h14">specified distribution platform</a> is a person other than the supplier or an <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/digital-economy/digital-economy-gsthst/digital-economy-definitions.html#h_6">excluded operator</a> who:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>controls or sets the essential elements of the transaction between the supplier and the recipient, or </li>
		<li>if that circumstance does not apply to any person, is involved, directly or through arrangements with third parties, in collecting, receiving or charging the consideration for the supply and transmitting all or part of the consideration to the supplier.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>In relation to a supply of property or a service, an <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/digital-economy/digital-economy-gsthst/digital-economy-definitions.html">excluded operator</a> is a person who: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>does not set, directly or indirectly, any of the terms and conditions under which the supply is made,</li>
		<li>is not involved, directly or indirectly, in authorizing the charge to the recipient of the supply in respect of the payment of the consideration for the supply, and</li>
		<li>is not involved, directly or indirectly, in the ordering or delivery of the property or in the ordering or rendering of the service;</li>
		<p>or</p>
		<li>solely provides for the listing or advertising of the property or service or for the redirecting or transferring to a <a href=" https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/digital-economy/digital-economy-gsthst/digital-economy-definitions.html">digital platform</a> on which the property or service is offered;</li>
		<p>or</p>
		<li>is solely a payment processor.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Generally, a <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/digital-economy/digital-economy-gsthst/digital-economy-definitions.html#h_14">specified distribution platform</a> is a <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/digital-economy/digital-economy-gsthst/digital-economy-definitions.html">digital platform</a> through which a person facilitates the making of <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/digital-economy/digital-economy-gsthst/digital-economy-definitions.html#h_17">specified supplies</a> by another person that is a <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/digital-economy/digital-economy-gsthst/digital-economy-definitions.html#h_15">specified non-resident supplier</a> who is not registered under the normal GST/HST registration regime.  A <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/digital-economy/digital-economy-gsthst/digital-economy-definitions.html">digital platform</a> generally includes a website, an electronic portal, gateway, store or distribution platform or any other similar electronic interface, but does not include an electronic interface that solely processes payments.</p>

	<p>In <strong>scenario (1)</strong> and <strong>scenario (2)</strong>, the <strong>non-resident vendor</strong> would be required to collect GST/HST on the specified supplies it makes directly to the specified Canadian recipients.</p>
	<p>In <strong>scenario (3)</strong> and in <strong>scenario (4)</strong>, the <strong>distribution platform operator</strong> would be required to collect GST/HST on the specified supplies made to the specified Canadian recipients that are facilitated through its platform.</p>
	<p>In <strong>scenario (5)</strong>, the <strong>non-resident vendor</strong> would be required to collect GST/HST on the specified supplies made to the specified Canadian recipients</p>

<h2 id="h_3">When to start charging and collecting</h2>
<p>You are required to begin charging and collecting the tax on the taxable supplies that you make in Canada as soon as you have registered for the GST/HST.  </p>
<p>After you have <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/digital-economy/digital-economy-gsthst/charge-collect.html">charged and collected tax</a> on the appropriate GST/HST type for your business</a>, <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/digital-economy/digital-economy-gsthst/file-return.html">you must complete and file a return.</a></p>
<h3>Disclosing the tax to customers</h3>
<p>You must indicate to your customers, such as on your receipts, invoices or contracts:</p>

<ul>
<li>the amount paid or payable for your digital supplies and the GST/HST paid or payable on that amount; or </li>
<li>that the GST/HST paid or payable on those supplies is included in the price. </li>
</ul>
	   <p>For information about charging and collecting GST/HST under the normal GST/HST regime, see <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/gst-hst-businesses/charge-collect-receipts-invoices.html">Receipts and Invoices</a>.</p>
<h2 id="h_4">What rate to charge</h2>
<p>The rate of tax that you would be required to charge and collect on specified digital supplies depends on whether they are made in Canada, and if so, whether they are made in a participating province. </p>
	   <p>Taxable supplies that are made in Canada are subject to GST at a rate of 5%, or HST at the harmonized rate if they are made in a participating province.  </p>
	   <p>The current rates of tax are:</p>
	   <ul>
		   <li>5% (GST) in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Quebec, Saskatchewan, and Yukon</li>
		   <li>13% (HST) in Ontario</li>
		   <li>15% (HST) in New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island</li>
	   </ul>
<p>To determine where your specified supplies are made, you must determine the status of your customer and the usual place of residence of your customer.</p>






<h3 id="h_4_1">Determining the status of your customers</h3>
<p>Your customer is a considered a specified Canadian recipient if:</p>

<ul>
<li>the usual place of residence of the customer is situated in Canada, and </li>
<li>the customer does not provide you with satisfactory evidence that the customer is registered for GST/HST under the standard GST/HST.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you obtain the GST/HST registration number of your customer who is registered for GST/HST under the standard GST/HST, you are not required to charge and collect GST/HST on the specified supply that you make to this customer.</p>


<h3 id="h_4_2">Determining the usual place of residence of your customers </h3>

<p>Follow these steps to determine the usual place of residence of your customers:</p>
<p><strong>Indicators of information</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Identify <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/digital-economy/digital-economy-gsthst/digital-economy-definitions.html">indicators of information in respect of the usual place of residence</a> of your customers, which are generally pieces of information that you obtain in the ordinary course of your operations.</p>
	   <p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Then apply <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/digital-economy/digital-economy-gsthst/digital-economy-definitions.html">indicators of location – Canada and province</a> in respect of your customers to those information indicators to identify their location.</p>
	   <p><strong>Step 3: Using the tables below, </strong>apply usual place of residence rules to these location indicators to determine if the usual place of residence is in Canada or in a participating province.</p>

<summary>Examples</summary>
<p><strong>Example 1 - Digital supply</strong></p>
<p>A non-resident vendor who is registered under the simplified GST/HST supplies subscription-based online music streaming directly to consumers around the world, including Canada.</p>
<p>The vendor supplies a monthly subscription to a particular consumer. In the ordinary course of its operations, the vendor only obtains a billing address and payment-related information from the consumer when the subscription is purchased.  These two pieces of information reasonably indicate a geographic location in Ontario, Canada.  The vendor does not obtain any other information about the consumer in connection with the supply, including any evidence that the consumer is registered for GST/HST under the standard GST/HST.</p>
<p>In this case, the consumer is considered to have a usual place of residence that is in Ontario, Canada.  The vendor would therefore be required to charge and collect HST at the rate of 13% in respect of the supply of the monthly subscription since it is made in the participating province of Ontario.</p>
<p>The usual place of residence of the consumer is considered to be situated in Canada since in the ordinary course of its operations the vendor has obtained two Canadian indicators in respect of the consumer and has not obtained more than one foreign indicator in respect of the consumer (Canada Rule 1). It is also considered to be situated in the participating province of Ontario since the vendor has obtained one or more participating province indicators in respect of the customer that are both situated in the same province and has not obtained any other information (Participating Province Rule 2).</p>

<p><strong>Example 2 - Digital supply</strong></p>
<p>The consumer in Example 1 moves from Ontario to British Columbia six months after purchasing the monthly music streaming subscription. The consumer updates their account with the non-resident vendor with a new billing address in British Columbia.</p>
<p>When the next monthly subscription payment subsequently becomes due, the vendor now has a billing address and payment-related information about the consumer that reasonably indicates a geographic location in British Columbia, Canada.  The vendor has not obtained any other information about the consumer in connection with the supply, including any evidence that the consumer is registered for GST/HST under the standard GST/HST.</p>
<p>In this case, the consumer is considered to have a usual place of residence that is in British Columbia, Canada.  The vendor would therefore be required to charge and collect GST at the rate of 5% in respect of the supply of the monthly subscription since it is made in a non-participating province. </p>
<p>For GST/HST purposes, a separate supply of the subscription is considered to be made for each monthly billing period and so the rate of tax to be charged and collected in respect of each such supply must be determined separately as each subscription payment becomes due.</p>
<p>The usual place of residence of the consumer in this case is considered to be situated in Canada since in the ordinary course of its operations the vendor has obtained two Canadian indicators in respect of the consumer and has not obtained more than one foreign indicator in respect of the consumer (Canada Rule 1). None of the participating province usual place of residence rules would apply to determine the usual place of residence of the consumer in this case to be in a participating province.  The supply is therefore made in a non-participating province.</p>

<p><strong>Example 3 - Digital supply</strong></p>
<p>A non-resident vendor who is registered under the simplified GST/HST supplies e-books directly to consumers around the world, including Canada.</p>
<p>A consumer purchases an e-book from the vendor using a mobile tablet.  At the time of purchase, in the ordinary course of its operations, the vendor obtains from the consumer a billing address, payment-related information, and the Internet Protocol address of the device used by the consumer to purchase the e-book.  The billing address, and payment-related information reasonably indicate a geographic location in Nova Scotia, Canada.  The Internet Protocol address reasonably indicates a geographic location in Mexico (where the consumer is vacationing for a few weeks). The vendor does not obtain any other information about the consumer in connection with the supply, including any evidence that the consumer is registered for GST/HST under the standard GST/HST.</p>
<p>In this case, the consumer is considered to have a usual place of residence that is in Nova Scotia, Canada.  The vendor would therefore be required to charge and collect HST at the rate of 15% in respect of the supply since it is made in the participating province of Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>The usual place of residence of the consumer is considered to be situated in Canada since in the ordinary course of its operations the vendor has obtained two Canadian indicators in respect of the consumer and has not obtained more than one foreign indicator in respect of the consumer (Canada Rule 1).  It is also considered to be situated in the participating province of Nova Scotia since the vendor has obtained one or more participating province indicators in respect of the customer that are both situated in the same province and has not obtained an equal or greater number of non-participating province indicators (Participating Province Rule 2).</p>
<p><strong>Example 4 - Architectural service</strong></p>
<p>A non-resident architect who is registered under the simplified GST/HST makes a supply of an architectural service to a Canadian consumer who lives in Ontario. The service relates to real property that is situated in Ontario. The architect performs the service entirely outside Canada.</p>
<p>In the ordinary course of its operations, the architect only obtains a home address in Ontario and payment-related information from the consumer when the architectural service is purchased. These two pieces of information reasonably indicate a geographic location in Ontario. The architect does not obtain any other information about the consumer in connection with the supply, including any evidence that the consumer is registered for GST/HST under the standard GST/HST.</p>
<p>The usual place of residence of the consumer is considered to be situated in Canada since in the ordinary course of its operations the architect has obtained two Canadian indicators in respect of the consumer and has not obtained more than one foreign indicator in respect of the consumer (Canada Rule 1).  Since the architectural service is a service that relates to real property, it would be the normal HST place of supply rules that apply to determine the province in which the supply of the architectural service is considered to be made. Therefore, the supply of the service is made in Ontario because it relates to real property that is situated in Ontario. The architect would therefore be required to charge and collect HST at the rate of 13% in respect of the supply.</p>
