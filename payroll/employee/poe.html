<h1 property="name" id="wb-cont" class="gc-thickline">Determine the province of employment (POE)</h1>

<p>When employers pay employment income such as salaries, wages, or commissions, the employee's province or territory of employment (POE) must be determined so that the proper provincial/territorial income tax deductions are withheld. The province of employment is determined by whether the employee physically (in person) reports at the employer's establishment.</p>

<details><summary>Income tax legislated by the province or territory</summary>
<p><strong>CRA's mandate </strong>is to <strong>administer </strong>provincial and territorial personal income tax as legislated by the province or territory. Any concerns regarding the tax policy of a province or territory should be directed to the applicable provincial or territorial Ministry of Finance.</p></details>

<h3>How to ask for a binding determination</h3>
<p>To obtain certainly and require a binding determination about the tax consequences of the proposed departure from or arrival in Canada, a person may ask the <strong>Income Tax Rulings Directorate (ITRD) </strong>to issue a binding advance income tax ruling with respect to the residency status of the person. The taxpayer may have to pay a fee to have ITRD complete such a request. For more information on how to ask for an advance income tax ruling, see <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/ic70-6.html">Information Circular IC 70-6R9, Advance Income Tax Rulings and Technical Interpretations</a> or <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/tax-professionals/income-tax-rulings-interpretations.html">Income tax rulings and interpretations</a>.</p>
