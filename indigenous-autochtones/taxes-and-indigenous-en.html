<h1 property="name" id="wb-cont">Taxes and benefits for Indigenous peoples</h1>
<section>

<p>As an Indigenous person, there may be some forms or processes specific to you. But in general, tax obligations are the same as any other resident in Canada.</p>
<p>We acknowledge that people may not want to be referred to using outdated terms, however, for the purposes of the tax exemption under section 87 of the Indian Act, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) uses the term "Indian" because it has a
legal meaning in the Indian Act.</p>

<li><a href="#covid">If you received COVID-related benefits</a></li>
<li><a href="#taxes">Doing your taxes</a></li>
<li><a href="#validation">If you received a validation letter</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="getting">Getting benefits and credits</h2>
		<p>There are some benefits that are only available if you file a tax return. It is important that you complete your taxes on time every year, even if you do not owe any taxes, if your income is tax exempt or if you had no income at all. The CRA uses the information from your tax return to determine your eligibility for benefits and credits and any related provincial and territorial payments.</p>
		<p>For example, the following benefits are available only once having filed:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/goods-services-tax-harmonized-sales-tax-gst-hst-credit.html">GST/HST credit</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/canada-child-benefit-overview.html">Canada child benefit (CCB)</a></li>
				<li>Child disability benefit</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/segments/tax-credits-deductions-persons-disabilities/disability-tax-credit.html">Disability Tax Credit</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/segments/northern-residents.html">Northern Residents Deduction</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/canada-workers-benefit.html">Canada Workers Benefit</a></li>
			</ul>
		<p>For information on benefits and credits for Indigenous peoples please see below:</p>
		<p><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/campaigns/canada-child-benefit-indigenous/information-indigenous-people.html">Benefits and credits: Information for Indigenous peoples</a></p>
	<h3>How personal circumstances affect access to benefits</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Update your marital status as soon as it changes, even if you are living in a common-law relationship. Once the CRA knows about your change in marital status, we will recalculate your payments, taking into consideration your new marital status and your new family net income.</li>
				<li>Keep your address up to date to ensure your benefit and credit payments do not stop.</li>
				<li>If the number of children in your care changes, let the CRA know. If you have a child that starts living with you, you start sharing custody of a child, or if a child is no longer in your care, this can effect the amount you receive.</li>
			</ul>
	<p><strong>Simplified Tax Returns</strong></p>
	<p>You may be eligible to use simplified returns called the <strong>T1S-D, Credit and Benefit Return</strong>, or the <strong>Let Us Help You Get Your Benefits, Credit and Benefit Short Return</strong> if you are registered under the Indian Act. These returns are not available to print from the CRA website. Your band council may already have some, or could order them for you. You can also ask a CRA outreach officer during a virtual outreach visit.</p>
	<p>You can use the <strong>T1S-D, Credit and Benefit Return</strong> only if <strong>all</strong> of the following apply:</p>
			<ul type="disc">
				<li>you lived in Newfoundland and Labrador, Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, or Alberta on December 31 of the tax year</li>
				<li>all your income is tax exempt (except for retroactive universal child care benefit payments, old age security pension payments, social assistance payments, and net federal supplements)</li>
				<li>no tax was deducted from any of your income (except Canada Emergency Response Benefits)</li>
				<li>you did not receive any working income tax benefits advance payments in the tax year</li>
			</ul>
	<p>You can use the <strong>Let Us Help You Get Your Benefits, Credit and Benefit Short Return</strong> if you meet the eligibility criteria listed on the form and <strong>all</strong> the following apply:</p>
			<ul type="disc">
				<li>you were a resident of Canada throughout the year</li>
				<li>your taxable income is less than the basic personal amount for the province or territory that you lived on December 31 of the tax year</li>
				<li>you are not claiming the eligible educator school supply tax credit</li>
				<li>you are not filing this return for a deceased person</li>
			</ul>
		
<h2 id="covid">If you received COVID-related benefits</h2>
		<p>If you received COVID-19 benefits, such as the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, Canada Recovery Benefit, Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit, or Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit. The benefits are taxable however, if some or all of your income is exempt from tax under section 87 of the Indian Act this has implications for the taxability of the emergency benefits you may have received.</p>
	<h3>If you received the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB)</h3>
		<p><strong> Will the CERB still be taxable if it's received by someone with status living on reserve?</strong></p>
			<p>The CERB you receive will be treated in the same way as your total income that entitled you to the CERB. This total income is your total income for 2019 (period 1) or the 12-month period prior to the date of your application (period 2).</p>
			<p>Therefore, if your total income that entitled you to the CERB in either period 1 or period 2 is exempt from income tax under section 87 of the Indian Act, your CERB will also be exempt. If your total income that entitled you to the CERB is partially exempt from tax in both periods, your CERB will also be partially exempt. The CERB will be treated as exempt in the same proportion as the total income of the period that is more advantageous to you. If your total income that entitled you to the CERB in one period is partially exempt and the total income in the other period is taxable, your CERB will be treated as exempt in the same proportion as the total income of the period that was partially exempt. If your total income that entitled you to the CERB is taxable in both periods, your CERB will also be taxable.</p>
		
		<p><strong>There are a number of possible scenarios:</strong></p>
		<ol class="lst-lwr-rmn">
		<strong><li>A person worked on reserve and earned tax-exempt employment income of $24,000 ($2,000 per month) in 2019 and still works on reserve and earned tax-exempt employment income of $3,000 in the first three months in 2020. </li>
		<li>A person worked on reserve and earned tax-exempt employment income of $24,000 ($2,000 per month) in 2019 but is not working on reserve in 2020 and earned taxable employment income of $6,000 in the first three months in 2020. </li>
		<li>A person worked off reserve and earned tax-exempt employment income according to guideline 2 of the Indian Act Exemption for Employment Income Guidelines of $24,000 ($2,000 per month) in 2019 but in 2020 changed employment and earned taxable employment income off reserve of $6,000 in the first three months in 2020.</li>
		<li>A person did not work on reserve and earned taxable employment income of $24,000 ($2,000 per month) in 2019, but is working on reserve in 2020 and earned tax-exempt employment income of $6,000 in the first three months in 2020. The person applied for the CERB on April 6, 2020.</li> 
		<li>A person did not work on reserve and earned taxable employment income of $24,000 in 2019 and is not working on reserve in 2020 and earned taxable income of $6,000 in the first three months in 2020.</li> 
		</ol>
		<p>In each scenario, will the CERB be taxable or not?</strong></p>
		<p>The CERB you receive will be treated in the same way as your total income that entitled you to the CERB.</p> 
		<ol class="lst-lwr-rmn">
		<li>In scenario 1, since your total income that entitled you to the CERB is exempt from income tax, your CERB will also be exempt.</li> 
		<li>In scenario 2, since your total income in 2019 that entitled you to the CERB is exempt from tax, your CERB will also be exempt. The fact that you had taxable income in 2020 will not make your CERB taxable or partially taxable. Your CERB will be treated in the way that is more advantageous to you. </li>
		<li>In scenario 3, since your total income in 2019 that entitled you to the CERB is exempt from tax, your CERB will also be exempt. The fact that you had taxable income in 2020 will not make your CERB taxable or partially taxable. Your CERB will be treated in the way that is more advantageous to you. </li>
		<li>In scenario 4, since your total income in the 12-month period prior to the date of your application that entitled you to the CERB is partially (25%) exempt from tax, your CERB will also be partially exempt from tax and will be prorated in the proportion in which your income was exempt. Even though your total income in 2019 was taxable your CERB will be treated in the way that is more advantageous to you.</li> 
		<li>In scenario 5, since of your total income that entitled you to the CERB is taxable, your CERB will also be taxable.</li>
		</ol>
		<p><strong>Will we have to pay tax on the CERB if we live in a community (considered income earned on reserve/confined to the house) but we work off reserve?</strong></p>
		<p>The CERB you receive will be treated in the same way as your total income that entitled you to the CERB. This total income is your total income for 2019 (period 1) or the 12-month period prior to the date of your application (period 2). Therefore, if your total income that entitled you to the CERB in either period 1 or period 2 is exempt from income tax under section 87 of the Indian Act, your CERB will also be exempt. If your total income that entitled you to the CERB is partially exempt from tax in both periods, your CERB will also be partially exempt. The CERB will be treated as exempt in the same proportion as the total income of the period that is more advantageous to you. If your total income that entitled you to the CERB in one period is partially exempt and the total income in the other period is taxable, your CERB will be treated as exempt in the same proportion as the total income of the period that was partially exempt. If your total income that entitled you to the CERB is taxable in both periods, your CERB will also be taxable.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Will CERB payments received by an entrepreneur be taxable? If yes, at what time?</strong></p>
		<p>The CERB is generally a taxable benefit. A T4A tax slip will be made available for the 2020 tax year in CRA My Account under Tax Information Slips (T4 and more). You will need to report any taxable CERB payments you receive on your 2020 income tax return. If you have a balance owing for 2020, your payment will be due on or before April 30, 2021. The CERB received by an entrepreneur will be treated in the same way as their total self-employment income that entitled them to the CERB. This total income is the entrepreneur’s total self-employment income for 2019 (period 1) or the 12-month period prior to the date of their application (period 2). Therefore, if the entrepreneur’s total self-employment income that entitled him or her to the CERB in either period 1 or period 2 is exempt from income tax under section 87 of the Indian Act, their CERB will also be exempt. If the entrepreneur’s total self-employment income that entitled him or her to the CERB is partially exempt from tax in both periods, their CERB will also be partially exempt. The CERB will be treated as exempt in the same proportion as the total self-employment income of the period that is more advantageous to the entrepreneur. If the entrepreneur’s total self-employment income that entitled him or her to the CERB in one period is partially exempt and the total self-employment income in the other period is taxable, the entrepreneur’s CERB will be treated as exempt in the same proportion as the total self-employment income of the period that was partially exempt. If the entrepreneur’s total self-employment income that entitled him or her to the CERB is taxable in both periods, their CERB will also be taxable.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Questions and Answers related to CERB<strong></p>
		<p><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/cerb-application/questions.html">Questions and answers related to the CERB</a></p>
		<p>If you mistakenly received COVID-19 emergency benefit payments, or your situation has changed since you first applied for one of these benefits, you can repay the CRA via My Account, online banking, or mail.</p>
		<p>The CRA is sympathetic to the fact that, for some individuals, repayment of these amounts may have financial implications. For this reason, payment arrangement parameters have been expanded to give Canadians more time and flexibility to repay based on their ability to pay. Individuals who cannot make a payment in full are advised to contact the CRA to make a payments arrangement.</p>

	<h3>If you received one of the recovery benefits (CRB, CRSB, CRCB)</h3>
		<p><strong>How do I collect the 10% tax withheld if my income is tax-exempt?</strong></p>
		<p>If you received one of the Canada Recovery Benefits 10% of the tax was withheld at source, including those individuals with income that may be exempt from tax. If some or all of your income is exempt from tax under section 87 of the Indian Act and you are registered, or entitled to
		be registered as an Indian under that Act, you may be able to get part or all of the tax back for payments received in 2020 or 2021 by filing a tax return for that year. This may include filling out Form T90, Income exempt under the Indian Act, as part of the return or you may be eligible for a simple return (see the Getting Benefits and Credits section on this page)</p>
		
		<p><strong>Will the recovery benefits I, as a First Nation individual, received in 2020 be exempt from tax under section 87 of the Indian Act?</strong></p>
		<p>The recovery benefits you receive will be treated in the same way as the total income that entitled you to these benefits.</p>
		<p>The recovery benefits are available to workers who earned a minimum total income of $5,000 (before taxes) from one or more of the following sources; employment income, self-employment income and/or provincial or federal benefits related to maternity or paternity leave.  Total income includes income exempt under section 87 of the Indian Act.</p>
		<p>If the recovery benefit is in respect of a two-week period beginning in 2020, this total income is your total income for either 2019 or the 12-month period preceding the day on which you made your application (straddle period).  Therefore, if the total income that entitled you to the recovery benefits in either 2019 or the straddle period is exempt from tax under section 87 of the Indian Act, your recovery benefits will also be exempt. If the total income that entitled you to the recovery benefits is partially exempt from tax in both 2019 and the straddle period, your recovery benefits will also be partially exempt.  Your recovery benefits will be treated as exempt in the same proportion as the total income of the period that is more advantageous to you.  If the total income that entitled you to the recovery benefits in one period is partially exempt and the total income in the other is taxable, your recovery benefits will be treated as exempt in the same proportion as the total income of the period that was partially exempt. If the total income that entitled you to the recovery benefits is taxable in both periods, your recovery benefits will also be taxable.</p>
		<p>In addition, if you have a combination of taxable and exempt income and you had a reduction of at least 50% in your average weekly exempt employment income or self-employment income that includes a reduction of exempt income, for reasons related to COVID-19, the recovery benefits you received may be exempt in the proportion of the exempt income lost over the total income lost, if this proportion is more advantageous to you.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Will the recovery benefits I, as a First Nation individual, received in 2021 be exempt from tax under section 87 of the Indian Act?</strong></p>
		<p>The recovery benefits you receive will be treated in the same way as the total income that entitled you to these benefits.</p>	
		<p>The recovery benefits are available to workers who earned a minimum total income of $5,000 (before taxes) from one or more of the following sources; employment income, self-employment income and/or provincial or federal benefits related to maternity or paternity leave.  Total income includes income exempt under section 87 of the Indian Act.</p>
		<p>If the benefit is in respect of a two-week period beginning in 2021, this total income is your total income for either 2019, 2020, or in the 12-month period preceding the day on which you made your the application (straddle period). Therefore, if the total income that entitled you to the benefits in 2019, 2020 or the straddle period is exempt from income tax under section 87 of the Indian Act, your recovery benefits will also be exempt. If the total income that entitled you to the Canada Recovery Benefits is partially exempt from tax in all the  periods , your Canada Recovery Benefits will also be partially exempt. The recovery benefits will be treated as exempt in the same proportion as the total income of the period that is more advantageous to you. If your total income that entitled you to the recovery benefits in two periods is partially exempt and the total income in the other period is taxable, your recovery benefits will be treated as exempt in the same proportion as the total income of the period that was partially exempt that is more advantageous to you. If your total income that entitled you to the recovery benefits in one period is partially exempt and the total income in the other periods is taxable, your recovery benefits will be treated as exempt in the same proportion as the total income of the period that was partially exempt. If your total income that entitled you to the recovery benefits is taxable in all  periods, your recovery benefits will also be taxable.</p>
		<p>In addition, if you have a combination of taxable and exempt income and you had a reduction of at least 50% in your average weekly exempt employment income or self-employment income that includes a reduction of exempt income, for reasons related to COVID-19, the recovery benefits you received may be exempt in the proportion of the exempt income lost over the total income lost, if this proportion is more advantageous to you.</p>
	
		<p><strong>If the CRB received by an individual is exempt from tax under section 87 of the Indian Act, should it be included in the individual's income determined under Part I of the Income Tax Act (the Act)?</strong></p>
		<p>No. The exempt CRB should not be included in the individual’s income pursuant to paragraph 81(1)(a) of the Act. Paragraph 81(1)(a) of the Act provides that amounts which are exempt from income tax by any other enactment of the Parliament of Canada (includes the Indian Act) shall
		not be included in computing the income of a taxpayer for a taxation year. Accordingly, the exempt income of an Indian under the Indian Act is not included in computing the income of a taxpayer under Part I of the Act.</p>
		<p>However, it should be noted that if the CRB received by an individual is not exempt from tax under section 87 of the Indian Act, it will be included in the individua l’s income in accordance with subparagraph 56(1)(r)(iv) of the Act.</p>
		
		<p><strong>If an individual was in receipt of the CRB in 2020 or 2021 and their entire income for 2020 or 2021 is exempt from tax under section 87 of the Indian Act, will the individual be subject to the repayment in that year?</strong></p>
		<p>No. An individual whose entire income in 2020 or 2021 is exempt from tax under section 87 of the Indian Act will not be subject to the CRB repayment in that year even if their income is greater than $38,000 for that year.</p>
		<p>An individua l’s “income” as defined in subsection 8(3) of the Canada Recovery Benefits Act (the CRBA) is determined under part I of the Income Tax Act. Paragraph 81(1)(a) of the Act excludes income exempt under section 87 of the Indian Act when computing the income of a
		taxpayer for a taxation year under Part I of the Act. The CRBA does not have a specific provision to include the section 87 exempt income for the purpose of calculating the income for repayment in subsection 8(2) of the CRBA. Pursuant to subsection 8(3) of the CRBA, an
		individual’s income exempt under section 87 of the Indian Act is not included in the calculation of income, and therefore, the individual is not subject to the CRB repayment specified in subsection 8(2) of the CRBA.</p>
		
		<p><strong>If an individual was in receipt of the CRB in 2020 or 2021 and has both exempt income and other income that is not exempt from tax in that year, will the individual be subject to the repayment in that year?</strong></p>
		<p>It depends on the facts of a particular situation. Pursuant to subsection 8(2) of the CRBA, an individual is required to repay an amount equal to 50 cents for every dollar of income earned in that year above $38,000 of income, up to the total amount of the CRB received by them in that
		year. Accordingly, if the individual has other income that is not exempt from tax that exceeds the stated amount of $38,000, they will be subject to the repayment of the CRB regardless of whether or not they have exempt income. On the other hand, if the individua l’s other income that
		is not exempt from tax is less than or equal to $38,000 for 2020 or 2021, the individual will not be subject to the repayment in that year.</p>

    <h3>If you're tax-exempt</h3>
	<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a major shift in the workforce, and you may have been required to work from your home on a reserve. As a result, your employment income could now be fully or partly exempt from tax under section 87. Or, you may have been required to work off-reserve because of workplace restrictions. Find out if your income is still exempt despite changes to your situation.</p>

<h2 id="validation">If you received a validation letter</h2>
		<p>It can be confusing and even scary to receive letters or messages from the CRA, and we understand that! </p>
		<p> It is important to read these communications carefully, however, as the CRA may be seeking validation of eligibility criteria for a benefit that you have recently applied for or already received. The CRA relies in part on information that is already on file
			to validate or confirm eligibility of applicants. If you receive a letter or message from the CRA it may simply mean that more information is needed to complete your benefit application, or verify you eligibility. We need the right information on file.</p>
		<p>Individuals may be asked to provide more information or documentation at the time of application, or even after receiving the benefit.</p>
<h3>Why you may have received one</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Collect missing employment income information</li>
				<li>Confirming the primary caregiver related to children in your care</li>
				<li>Updating your contact information (e.g. your address)</li>
			</ul>	
<h3>What you can do once you’ve received one</h3>
		<p>It is important that you reply and provide all the information requested or your benefits may stop. The CRA has resources to help you provide the information.</p>
