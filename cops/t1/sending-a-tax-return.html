	<p>Filing online is the fastest and easiest way to do your taxes. There are several secure service options to file your taxes online. </p>

This includes your address, marital status, or direct deposit information with the CRA. </p>

			 <p>Before you submit your 2021 taxes, you will be asked to enter your NETFILE access code. You enter this access code after your name, date of birth, and social insurance number (SIN). You can find your <strong>8-character access code</strong> under the “Notice details” box of a previous tax year’s Notice of Assessment (NOA). An access code is not available if you are filing your tax return for the first time. </p>
			 <p>If you submit your taxes using your access code, you can use your 2021 tax information to confirm your identity when you need to contact the CRA. If you decide not to enter your access code, the CRA must rely on other information to confirm your identity. </p>

<p>For the <span class="nowrap">2021 tax year</span>, prior to filing your tax return electronically with NETFILE, you will be asked to enter an <strong>Access code</strong> after your name, date of birth, and social insurance number.

<p><span class="nowrap">Auto-fill</span> my return is a&nbsp;secure <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA </abbr>service that lets you or your authorized service provider automatically fill in certain parts of your current year return. The CRA will have most tax information from most tax slips, such as T4s,&nbsp;as well as registered retirement savings plan information, and carry forward amounts.</p>
<p>To <span class="nowrap">auto-fill</span> your return, you&nbsp;must be registered with <a href="account-individuals.html"><span class="nowrap">My Account</span></a> and be using a certified software product that offers this option.

        <h2>By mail</h2>
<p>Whether you are a resident or a <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span>, you can mail your return to your <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information/where-mail-your-paper-t1-return.html">tax centre</a>.</p>
<p>Online tax returns are processed without delays, but paper returns take longer to process, and could take even longer because of <span class="nowrap">COVID-19</span>. Filing online is the fastest and easiest way to do your taxes, and if you’re signed up for direct deposit, you can get your refund in as little as <span class="nowrap">eight business</span> days.</p>
<p>If you prepare your&nbsp;return or other people’s returns, mail or deliver each person’s return in a separate envelope. However, if you file returns for more than one year for the same person, put them all in one envelope.</p>
