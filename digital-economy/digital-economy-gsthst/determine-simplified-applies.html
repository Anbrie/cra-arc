<h3>Cross-border digital products and services</h3>
<p>You may choose to apply to be registered under the simplified GST/HST or be eligible to apply under the standard GST/HST. You may not be registered under both GST/HST at the same time.</p>
<p>You must register for one of the forms of GST/HST if:</p>
<ul class="lst-spcd">
<li>your registration threshold amount exceeds $30,000 CAD over a 12-month period</li>
<li>you are a non-resident who is not registered for GST/HST under the  <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/gst-hst-businesses/when-register-charge.html">standard GST/HST</a> and who is not <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/p-051r2.html">carrying on business in Canada</a>, and

<li>you are a non-resident <strong>distribution platform operator </strong>who makes specified supplies or facilitates the making of such supplies by such vendors through your platform.</li>

<details>
<summary>Calculate your cross-border digital products and services registration threshold</summary>
<p>The threshold amount in relation to digital supplies for a period is equal to:</p>
<ul class="lst-spcd">
<li>If you are a specified non-resident supplier, the total of all your revenues for a period that are, or that could reasonably be expected to be, from your specified supplies made to specified Canadian recipients,  <strong>but not including </strong>such supplies that are facilitated by a distribution platform operator that is registered for any GST/HST and that are deemed to have made by that operator.</li>
<li>If you are a non-resident distribution platform operator, the total of all your revenues for a period that are, or that could reasonably be expected to be, from your specified supplies made to specified Canadian recipients, <strong>including</strong> the specified supplies of non-resident vendors (other than those registered under the standard GST/HST) to consumers in Canada that you or any other operator facilitate through that platform.</li>
<li>If you are a specified non-resident supplier who makes digital supplies to Canadian consumers through a non-resident distribution platform who is registered under either the simplified GST/HST or standard GST/HST, those supplies are <strong>not</strong> included in the calculation of your threshold amount. They are instead included in the calculation of the threshold amount of distribution platform operator. If these are the only supplies that you make as a non-resident vendor, you would therefore not have an obligation to register for GST/HST.</li>
<li>If, on <strong>July 1, 2021</strong>, your threshold amount is <strong>more than $30,000</strong>, you would be required to be registered for the GST/HST under the proposed measure on that date, and to apply for registration by that date.</li>
<li>If, on <strong>July 1, 2021</strong>, your threshold amount is <strong>$30,000 CAD or less</strong>, you would not be required to be registered for the GST/HST on that date under the proposed measure. However, you must ensure that you regularly recalculate your threshold amount to determine whether it is more than $30,000 CAD. If it is, you must register for the GST/HST.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example 1 - Registration threshold amount of specified non-resident supplier exceeded on July 1, 2021</strong></p>
<p>A non-resident vendor who is not registered for GST/HST makes specified supplies of online subscription-based video streaming directly to customers around the world, including Canadian consumers.  The total revenues of the vendor from these supplies to Canadian consumers for the 12-month period preceding July 1, 2021 are $500,000,000 CAD.</p>
<p>Based on its past and projected revenues, the expected total revenues of the vendor from digital supplies to Canadian consumers for the 12-month period beginning on July 1, 2021, is $500,000,000 CAD on July 1, 2021. The threshold amount of the vendor is therefore $500,000,000 CAD on July 1, 2021. Because the threshold amount of the vendor exceeds $30,000 CAD on July 1, 2021, the vendor is required to be registered on that day and is required to apply for registration on that day.</p>
<p><strong>Example 2 - Registration threshold amount of specified non-resident supplier not exceeded on July 1, 2021</strong></p>
<p>A non-resident vendor who is not registered for GST/HST makes specified supplies of digital apps directly to customers around the world, including Canadian consumers.  The total revenues of the vendor from these supplies to Canadian consumers for the 12-month period preceding July 1, 2021 are $20,000 CAD.</p>
<p>Based on its past and projected revenues, the expected total revenues of the vendor from digital supplies to Canadian consumers for the 12-month period beginning on July 1, 2021, is $20,000 CAD on July 1, 2021. The threshold amount of the vendor is therefore $20,000 CAD on July 1, 2021. Because the threshold amount of the vendor does not exceed $30,000 CAD on July 1, 2021, the vendor is not required to be registered on that day and is not required to apply for registration on that day.</p>
<p><strong>Example 3 - Registration threshold amount of distribution platform operator exceeded on July 1, 2021</strong></p>
<p>A non-resident distribution platform operator who is not registered for GST/HST operates a digital platform through which non-registered non-resident vendors make specified supplies of digital apps to customers around the world, including Canadian consumers.  The total revenues of the non-resident vendors from these supplies to Canadian consumers are $700,000,000 CAD for the 12-month period preceding July 1, 2021. The total revenues of the platform operator for its own digital apps that it supplies directly to Canadian consumers are $200,000,000 CAD for the 12-month period preceding July 1, 2021. The total revenues of the platform operator for its supplies made to the non-resident vendors who use its platform are $10,000,000 CAD for the 12-month period preceding July 1, 2021.</p> 
<p>Based on its past and projected revenues, the expected total revenues of the platform operator from its own digital supplies to Canadian consumers, including the revenues of the vendors making such supplies that are facilitated through the platform, for the 12-month period beginning on July 1, 2021, is $900,000,000 CAD. The threshold amount of the platform operator is therefore $900,000,000 CAD on July 1, 2021. Since the threshold amount of the platform operator exceeds $30,000 CAD on July 1, 2021, the platform operator is required to be registered on that day and is required to apply for registration on that day. </p>

<h3>Sale of goods located in Canada</h3>
<p>There is no simplified GST/HST option available for your business at this time. You would have to register for the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/gst-hst-businesses/when-register-charge.html">standard GST/HST</a>.</p>
<p>Your business may have to register for the standard GST/HST if:</p>

<ul class="lst-spcd">
<li>your registration threshold amount exceeds $30,000 CAD over a 12-month period</li>
<li>you are a non-resident who is not registered for GST/HST under the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/gst-hst-businesses/when-register-charge.html">standard GST/HST</a> and who is not <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/p-051r2.html">carrying on business in Canada</a> </li>
<li>you sell taxable goods (qualifying tangible personal property supply) that are delivered or made available to the purchaser in Canada, including goods that are:

<summary>Calculate your sales of goods registration threshold</summary>

<p>The threshold amount in relation to qualifying sales of goods for a period is equal to:</p>
<ul class="lst-spcd">
<li>If you are a non-resident vendor, the total of all your revenues for a period that are, or that could reasonably be expected to be, from your qualifying sales of goods made to specified recipients, <strong>but not including</strong> such supplies that are facilitated by a distribution platform operator that is registered for the GST/HST and that are deemed to have made by that operator.</li>

<li>If you are a distribution platform operator, the total of all your revenues for a period that are, or that could reasonably be expected to be, from your qualifying sales of goods made to specified recipients, <strong>including</strong> the qualifying sales of goods of non-registered vendors to specified recipients that you facilitate through your platform.</li>

<li>If, on <strong>July 1, 2021</strong>, your threshold amount is <strong>more than $30,000</strong>, you would be required to be registered for the GST/HST under the proposed measure on that date, and to apply for registration by that date.</li>
<li>If, on <strong>July 1, 2021</strong>, your threshold amount is <strong>$30,000 CAD or less</strong>, you would not be required to be registered for the GST/HST on that date under the proposed measure. However, you must ensure that you regularly recalculate your threshold amount to determine whether it is more than $30,000 CAD. If it is, you must register for the GST/HST.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example 1 - Registration threshold amount of non-resident vendor exceeded on July 1, 2021</strong></p>
<p>A non-resident vendor who is not registered for GST/HST and not carrying on business in Canada makes qualifying sales of goods directly to customers around the world, including consumers in Canada.  The total revenues of the vendor from these supplies to specified recipients for the 12-month period preceding July 1, 2021 are $6,000,000 CAD.</p>
<p>Based on its past and projected revenues, the expected total revenues of the vendor from qualifying sales of goods directly to specified recipients for the 12-month period beginning on July 1, 2021, is $6,000,000 CAD on July 1, 2021. The registration threshold amount of the vendor is therefore $6,000,000 CAD on July 1, 2021. Because the registration threshold amount of the vendor exceeds $30,000 CAD on July 1, 2021, the vendor is required to be registered on that day, and is required to apply for registration on that day.</p>
<p><strong>Example 2 - Registration threshold amount of non-resident vendor not exceeded on July 1, 2021</strong></p>
<p>A non-registered non-resident vendor who is not registered for GST/HST and not carrying on business in Canada makes qualifying sales of goods directly to customers around the world, including Canadian consumers.  The total revenues of the vendor from these supplies to specified recipients for the 12-month period preceding July 1, 2021 are $25,000 CAD.</p>
<p>Based on its past and projected revenues, the expected total revenues of the vendor from qualifying sales of goods to specified recipients for the 12-month period beginning on July 1, 2021, is $25,000 CAD on July 1, 2021. The registration threshold amount of the vendor is therefore $25,000 CAD on July 1, 2021. Because the registration threshold amount of the vendor does not exceed $30,000 CAD on July 1, 2021, the vendor is not required to be registered on that day and is not required to apply for registration on that day.</p>
<p><strong>Example 3 - Registration threshold amount of distribution platform operator exceeded on July 1, 2021</strong></p>
<p>A non-resident distribution platform operator who is not registered for GST/HST and not carrying on business in Canada operates a digital platform through which non-registered vendors make qualifying sales of goods to customers around the world, including Canadian consumers.  The total revenues of the non-resident vendors from these supplies to specified recipients are $50,000,000 CAD for the 12-month period preceding July 1, 2021. The total revenues of the platform operator for its own qualifying sales of goods that it supplies directly to specified recipients are $30,000,000 CAD for the 12-month period preceding July 1, 2021. The total revenues of the platform operator for its supplies made to the non-registered vendors who use its platform are $5,000,000 CAD for the 12-month period preceding July 1, 2021. </p>

The threshold amount of the platform operator is therefore $80,000,000 CAD on July 1, 2021. Since the threshold amount of the platform operator exceeds $30,000 CAD on July 1, 2021, the platform operator is required to be registered on that day, and is required to apply for registration on that day. </p>

<h3>Platform-based short-term accommodation</h3>
<p>You may choose to apply to be registered under the simplified GST/HST or be eligible to apply under the standard GST/HST. You may not be registered under both GST/HST at the same time.</p>
<p>You must register for one of the forms of GST/HST if:</p>

<li>your threshold amount exceeds $30,000 CAD over a 12-month period. </li>
<li>supply taxable short-term accommodation in Canada that is facilitated through an accommodation platform </li>
<li>if you are an accommodation platform operator who facilitates such supplies through your accommodation platform. </li>

<details>
<summary>Calculate your platform-based short-term accommodation threshold</summary>

<p>As an accommodation platform operator your threshold amount is equal to the total of all your revenues for a period that are, or that could reasonably be expected to be:</p>
<ul class="lst-spcd">
<li>from taxable supplies of short-term accommodation situated in Canada that are facilitated during the period through your accommodation platform, and made by vendors who are not registered under the standard GST/HST to recipients who are not registered under the standard GST/HST; and </li>
<li>from taxable supplies of services that you make during the period to persons who are not registered under the standard GST/HST in connection with supplies of short-term accommodation situated in Canada that are made to them, and for which you charge a booking fee, administration fee or other similar charge (Canadian accommodation related supplies).</li>
<li>If, on <strong>July 1, 2021</strong>, your threshold amount is <strong>more than $30,000</strong>, you would be required to be registered for the GST/HST under the proposed measure on that date, and to apply for registration by that date.</li>
<li>If, on <strong>July 1, 2021</strong>, your threshold amount is <strong>$30,000 CAD or less</strong>, you would not be required to be registered for the GST/HST on that date under the proposed measure.

</ul>
<p><strong>Example 1 - Registration threshold amount of accommodation platform operator exceeded on July 1, 2021</strong></p>
<p>A non-resident accommodation platform operator who is not registered for GST/HST operates an accommodation platform through which non-registered vendors make supplies of accommodation to customers around the world, including taxable supplies of short-term accommodation situated in Canada.  The total revenues of the non-registered vendors from these supplies of short-term accommodation situated in Canada are $500,000,000 CAD for the 12-month period preceding July 1, 2021. The total revenues of the accommodation platform operator from Canadian accommodation related supplies in connection with the supplies of short-term accommodation are $20,000,000 CAD for the 12-month period preceding July 1, 2021.</p> 
<p>Based on its past and projected revenues, the threshold amount of the accommodation platform operator is therefore $520,000,000 CAD on July 1, 2021. Since the threshold amount of the platform operator exceeds $30,000 CAD on July 1, 2021, the platform operator is required to be registered on that day, and is required to apply for registration on that day. </p>
