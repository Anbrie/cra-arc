<p>It is the obligation of the taxpayer, the employer and the payee to report the income accurately. The employer can correct a <strong>reporting error</strong>.</p>
<p> The employer <strong>cannot change the nature of the income paid </strong>(for example, from salary to dividends). This is considered retroactive tax planning and is viewed as inaccurately changing the reporting of the income.</p>

<details><summary>You made an overpayment of salary, wages, or other remuneration to your employee. The employee does not repay you. </summary>
<h3 id="h_4_1">How to correct the overpayment</h3>
<p>If you already issued an original T4 slip for the year the salary overpayment was made, and you did not include the overpayment in the original T4, you <strong>must </strong>prepare an <strong>amended </strong>T4 slip (in the year the employee was overpaid) and <strong>increase </strong>the following by the amount of the overpayment:</p>

<ul>
<li>total employment income (<strong>Box 14</strong>) </li>
<li>income tax deducted (<strong>Box 22</strong>) </li>
<li>CPP contributions (<strong>Box 16</strong>) </li>
<li>EI premiums (<strong>Box 18</strong>) </li>
<li>insurable and pensionable earnings (<strong>Box 24 </strong>and <strong>Box 26</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p>If the <strong>corrected </strong>earnings are <strong>above </strong>the maximum insurable/pensionable earnings, you must still make sure that the maximum insurable/pensionable earnings as well as the corresponding EI/CPP deductions are reported on the employee's slip.</p>
<h3 id="h_4_2">What is the time limit for amending the T4 slip</h3>
<p>Generally, there is no time limit to amend T4 slips. When you file T4 slips, the amounts reported for CPP, EI and income tax are deemed to have been deducted, and <strong>do not </strong>fall under the "statute barred" rules. </p>
<h3 id="h_4_3">How to request for a refund</h3>
<p>You cannot request a refund of your share of the CPP contributions and EI premiums in this situation because the employee did not repay you for the salary overpayment.</p>
</details>


<details><summary>You made an overpayment of salary, wages, or other remuneration to your employee and the employee repays you. </summary>
<h3 id="h_5_1">The employee did not perform their duties or the amount paid is more than three years after the end of the year in which the salary was overpaid</h3>
<p>You employee should repay the <strong>gross </strong>amount of a salary overpayment if <strong>all </strong>of the following conditions are met:</p>

<ul>
<li>your employee did not report to work </li>
<li>your employee received a payment during the leave period that they would normally be entitled to under the terms of their employment contract or collective agreement </li>
<li>your employee's circumstances have changed, and is no longer entitled to salary or wages </li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of when an employee did not perform their duties </p>

<ul>
<li>You paid your employee a maternity leave top-up amount, but she did not return to work as required under the terms of her collective agreement. </li>
<li>You advanced vacation leave credits, but the employee quits working for you before earning the credits. </li>
<li>You paid a signing bonus to your employee, but he did not work for the time agreed to in his employment contract. </li>
</ul>
<h4>How to correct the overpayment</h4>
<p>If the employee repays the overpayment in the same year or a different year:</p>

<ul>
<li>Include the overpayment and corresponding deductions on the employee's T4 slip </li>
<li>If you allowed your employee to repay an overpayment in instalments, you may have to calculate a taxable interest benefit (see <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/t4130/employers-guide-taxable-benefits-allowances.html#P887_111004">Loans &ndash; interest-free and low-interest</a>) </li>
<li><strong>Do not </strong>adjust the slip or the payroll records to reduce the total employment income or source deductions by the amount of the repayment </li>
<li>Provide a letter to the employee confirming the following information:
<ul>
<li>Reason for the overpayment </li>
<li>When the overpayment was included in the employee's income </li>
<li>Date and amount of the repayment </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>What is the time limit for amending the T4 slip</h4>
<p>Generally, there is no time limit to amend T4 slips. When you file T4 slips, the amounts reported for CPP, EI and income tax are deemed to have been deducted, and <strong>do not </strong>fall under the "statute barred" rules. </p>
<h4>How to request for a refund</h4>

<h3 id="h_5_2">You made a clerical, administrative, or system error and the mount paid is less than three years after the end of the year in which the salary was overpaid</h3>
<p><strong>Repayment of net salary</strong></p>
<p>You may <strong>elect </strong>to have the employee repay the <strong>net amount </strong>of the salary overpayment (gross pay, less source deductions) if <strong>all </strong>of the following conditions are met:</p>

<ul>
<li>the overpayment was a result of a clerical, administrative, or system error </li>
<li>the business is actively operating </li>
<li>prior to making this election, you did <strong>not </strong>issue a slip with the employee's correct earnings (with the salary overpayment removed) </li>
<li>it is no later than <strong>three years </strong>after the end of the year in which the salary was overpaid and:
<ul>
<li>the employee repaid or arranged to repay the net amount of the salary overpayment </li>
<li>the election is made according to the following established procedure, which is done either by:
<ul>
<li>excluding the salary overpayment from an original T4 slip </li>
<li>amending the T4 slip to remove the overpayment and reducing the corresponding deductions that were withheld and remitted (when applicable) </li>
</ul>

<h4>Which form to use</h4>
<p>No form is required to make this election. The election is made by either excluding the salary overpayment from an original slip or amending a slip to remove the overpayment and reducing the corresponding income tax you deducted, as well as the CPP contributions and EI premiums you withheld and remitted (when applicable).</p>
<h4>How to correct the overpayment</h4>
<p>If you already issued an original slip for the year the salary overpayment was made, you <strong>must </strong>prepare an <strong>amended </strong>T4 slip and <strong>reduce </strong>the following by the amount of the overpayment:</p>

<ul>
<li>total employment income (<strong>Box 14</strong>) </li>
<li>income tax deducted (<strong>Box 22</strong>) </li>
<li>CPP contributions (<strong>Box 16</strong>) </li>
<li>EI premiums (<strong>Box 18</strong>) </li>
<li>insurable and pensionable earnings (<strong>Box 24 </strong>and <strong>Box 26</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p>If the <strong>corrected </strong>earnings are <strong>above </strong>the maximum insurable/pensionable earnings, you must still make sure that the maximum insurable/pensionable earnings as well as the corresponding EI/CPP deductions are reported on the employee's slip.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1 &ndash; Annual pensionable and insurable earnings are below the maximum</strong></p>
<p>In 2020, your employee earned $36,000. One year later, after you issued the original 2020 T4 slip, you discover you overpaid them by $1,000 because of a system error. From the overpayment, you had deducted income tax of $100, CPP contributions of $52.50, and EI premiums of $15.80.</p>
<p>In 2021, your employee agrees to repay the net amount of the salary overpayment. You should amend their 2020 T4 slip to reduce each of the following amounts by $1,000:</p>

<ul>
<li>total employment income in box 14 </li>
<li>CPP pensionable earnings in box 26 </li>
<li>EI insurable earnings in box 24 </li>
</ul>
<p>You should also reduce:</p>

<ul>
<li>the amount of income taxes deducted in box 22 by $100 </li>
<li>the CPP contributions in box 16 by $52.50 </li>
<li>the EI premiums in box 18 by $15.80 </li>
</ul>
<p>You can reduce your next payroll remittance to the CRA by the following amounts:</p>

<ul>
<li>$100 of income tax deducted on the salary overpayment </li>
<li>$52.50 of CPP contributions deducted on the salary overpayment </li>
<li>$15.80 of EI premiums deducted on the salary overpayment </li>
<li>your $52.50 share of CPP contributions </li>
<li>your $22.12 share of EI premiums </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example 2 &ndash; Annual pensionable and insurable earnings are above the maximum</strong></p>
<p>In 2020, your employee earned $60,000. One year later, after you issued the original 2020 T4 slip, you discover you overpaid them by $10,000, because of a system error. In 2021, your employee agrees to repay the net amount of the salary overpayment.</p>
<p>You should amend their 2020 T4 slip to reduce:</p>

<ul>
<li>total employment income in box 14 by $10,000 </li>
<li>CPP pensionable earnings in box 26 by $8,700 (maximum pensionable earnings of $58,700 minus corrected earnings of $50,000) </li>
<li>EI insurable earnings in box 24 by $4,200 (maximum insurable earnings of $54,200 minus corrected earnings of $50,000) </li>
</ul>
<p>You should also reduce:</p>

<ul>
<li>income taxes deducted in box 22 by $2,200 (the amount deducted on the salary overpayment of $10,000) </li>
<li>CPP contributions in box 16 by $456.75 (the $8,700 difference between the maximum pensionable earnings and the corrected earnings multiplied by the 5.25% employee CPP contribution rate) </li>
<li>EI premiums in box 18 by $66.36 (the $4,200 difference between the maximum insurable earnings and the corrected earnings multiplied by the 1.58% employee EI premium rate) </li>
</ul>
<p>You can reduce your next payroll remittance to the CRA by the following amounts:</p>

<ul>
<li>$2,200 of income tax deducted on the salary overpayment </li>
<li>$456.75 of CPP contributions deducted on the salary overpayment </li>
<li>$66.36 of EI premiums deducted on the salary overpayment </li>
<li>your $456.75 share of CPP contributions </li>
<li>your $92.90 share of EI premiums </li>
</ul>
<h4>What is the time limit for amending the T4 slip</h4>
<p>Generally, there is no time limit to amend T4 slips. When you file T4 slips, the amounts reported for CPP, EI and income tax are deemed to have been deducted, and <strong>do not </strong>fall under the "statute barred" rules. </p>
<h4>What happens once you amend the slip</h4>
<p>After the CRA receives and processes the amended the slip, it will credit the income tax, CPP contributions, and EI premiums remitted on the salary overpayment made in error (including your share of CPP contributions and EI premiums) to your payroll program account. You can then reduce, by the credited amount, the next payroll remittance you send to the CRA. The credited amount will be shown on your PD7A statement of account.</p>
<h4>What happens if the earnings are above the maximum</h4>
<p>If the employee's corrected earnings are above the maximum annual earnings, you have to include on the slip the CPP contributions or the EI premiums withheld on the salary overpayment.</p>
<p><strong>Repayment of gross salary</strong></p>
<p>Your employee should repay the <strong>gross </strong>amount of a salary overpayment if either of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>you did <strong>not </strong>elect to have the employee repay the <strong>net amount </strong>of the salary overpayment </li>
<li>the conditions to repay the <strong>net amount </strong>of the salary overpayment <strong>are not </strong>met </li>
</ul>
<p>Examples &ndash; Employee repaying the net amount of the salary overpayment </p>
<p><strong>Example &ndash; Employee repaying the gross amount of the salary overpayment</strong></p>
<p>In 2020, your employee earned $36,000. One year after you issued the original T4 slip, you discover you overpaid them by $500 because of a calculation error. You do not elect to have them repay the net amount, and they agree to repay you the gross amount in 2021. You should amend their 2020 T4 slip to reduce the total employment income in box 14, as well as the CPP pensionable and EI insurable earnings in boxes 26 and 24 by $500. Do not adjust the amount of CPP contributions, EI premiums, or income tax deducted in boxes 16, 18, and 22.</p>
<p>You can then ask for a refund of your share of CPP contributions and EI premiums by filling out Form PD24 and sending it to the CRA. The employee will not be able to claim a deduction from income in the 2021 tax year for the repayment, but they can ask the CRA to adjust their 2020 income tax and benefit return.</p>
<h4>How to correct the overpayment</h4>
<p>If you already issued an original slip for the year the salary overpayment was made, you <strong>must </strong>prepare an <strong>amended </strong>T4 slip and <strong>reduce </strong>the following by the amount of the overpayment:</p>

<ul>
<li>total employment income (<strong>Box 14</strong>) </li>
<li>income tax deducted (<strong>Box 22</strong>) </li>
<li>CPP contributions (<strong>Box 16</strong>) </li>
<li>EI premiums (<strong>Box 18</strong>) </li>
<li>insurable and pensionable earnings (<strong>Box 24 </strong>and <strong>Box 26</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p>If the <strong>corrected </strong>earnings are <strong>above </strong>the maximum insurable/pensionable earnings, you must still make sure that the maximum insurable/pensionable earnings as well as the corresponding EI/CPP deductions are reported on the employee's slip.</p>
<h4>How to request a refund for the employer's share</h4>
<p>You can request a refund be sending a completed <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/pd24.html">Form PD24, Application for a Refund of Overdeducted CPP Contributions or EI Premiums</a>. </p>
<p>Under the "statute barred" rules, you can request a refund for:</p>

<li>EI, up to <strong>three years </strong>after the end of the year in which it was deducted </li>
