	<h2 id="h-1">Present information gradually through progressive disclosure</h2>
	 <p>Progressive disclosure is the concept of presenting the right information at the right time, and moving secondary information to a secondary level. By sequencing the content or actions over several pages, it allows the user to make effective choices. Choices should be logical and effortless, so as not to overwhelm the user with too much information on any given page.</p>
      <p>Progressive  disclosure reduces complexity of user interaction as well as their cognitive  load; it helps with decision making and increases efficiency and ease of use of  the interface. To apply this principle effectively:</p>
      <ul class="fa-ul lst-spcd">
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span>Focus on the information the user needs to complete a specific task</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span>Provide the right level of detail at the right time; consider if you should  move from abstract to specific, from basic to expert</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span>Limit the number of choices to reduce potential confusion</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span>Don&rsquo;t overwhelm users with too much information at once; they will waste  time trying to figure out what information is relevant or what links to click  on, amidst the many options</li>

        <p>The term "cognitive load" was originally coined by psychologists to describe the mental effort required to learn new information. Though web browsing is a much more casual activity than formal education, cognitive load is still important: users must 'learn' how to use a site's navigation, layout, and transactional forms. And even when the site is fairly familiar, users must still carry around the information that is relevant to their goal. For instance, when planning a vacation, the users&rsquo; cognitive load includes interface-related knowledge and specific vacation-related constraints that they may have (such as price and timeframe).</p>
        <p>When a computer can't handle our processing demands, we can simply upgrade to a newer, more powerful machine. But to date there's no way to increase the actual processing power of our brains. Instead, designers must understand and accommodate these limits.</p>

	<h2 id="h-2">Write in complete blocks</h2>
	<p>Site  visitors do not access the same web pages during every visit, nor do they  access them in the same order during every visit. For this reason, write each web  page so it can stand on its own. Don't make assumptions as to what users have  previously read or will subsequently read. Web usage is never linear.</p>
      <p>In  some instances, you need to repeat phrases or sentences across many web pages  so that the information on each page is complete. If you repeat a lot of  supporting content, you may want to create a new page for that information and  link to it from the other pages or you may have to <a href="planning-e.html#h_6">reuse and recycle content in another way</a>.</p>
      <blockquote class="mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <p>When we look at a webpage, we tend to see it not as a whole, but rather   as compartmentalized chunks of information. We tend to read in blocks,   going directly to items that seem to match what we're actively looking   for.</p>
        <p>An eye-tracking study conducted by Nielsen revealed an eye-movement   pattern that could further support this idea that web users do indeed   read in chunks: We swipe our eyes from left to right, then continue on   down the page in an F-shaped pattern, skipping a lot of text in between.</p>
        <p>We can do several things to accommodate these reading patterns. One   strategy is to break up long articles into sections so that users can   easily skim down the page. This applies to block reading (because blocks   of text are denoted by headings) as well as the F-shaped pattern,   because we're attracted to the headings as we move down the page.</p>

	<h2 id="h-3">Consider page length</h2>
	 <p>Historically,  content was broken down into smaller chunks and spread over numerous pages, as  users did not scroll down. This is no longer true today. Although a user spends  most of their time viewing information above the fold (the part of a webpage that is visible without scrolling), a strong <a href="#scent">scent of information</a> prompts  them to explore the rest of the page. Users need a reason to scroll. <a href="findability-e.html#h_1">Organize your page structure</a> in a way that highlights the most important information at the top, so that a user has an interest in reading information below the fold.</p>
      <blockquote class="mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <p>Web users spend 80% of their time looking at  information above the page fold. Although users do scroll, they  allocate only 20% of their attention below the fold. </p>
        <p>During the Web's first years, users often didn't scroll Web pages at  all...Today, users will scroll. However, you shouldn't ignore the fold  and create endless pages for two reasons: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Long pages continue to be problematic because of users' limited attention span</li>
          <li>The real estate above the fold is more valuable than the stuff below the fold for attracting and keeping users' attention</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So, yes, you can put information below the fold rather than limit  yourself to bite-sized pages. <strong>In fact, if you have a long article, it's  better to present it as one scrolling canvas than to split it across  multiple page views. Scrolling beats paging because it's easier for  users to simply keep going down the page than it is to decide whether  or not to click through for a next page of a fragmented article.</strong> But  no, the fact that users scroll doesn't free you from prioritizing and  making sure that anything truly important remains above the fold.  Information foraging theory states that people decide whether to  continue along a path (including scrolling path down a page) based on  the current content's information scent. In other words, users will  scroll below the fold only if the information above it makes them  believe the reset of the page will be valuable. </p>

        <p>Although people weren't used to scrolling in the mid-nineties,  nowadays it's absolutely natural to use the browser's scrollbar. For a  continuous and lengthy content, like an article or a tutorial,  scrolling provides even better usability than slicing up the text to  several pages. </p>

        <p> What do users hate more: long pages full of information that require lengthy scrolling or having to drill down through multiple&mdash;albeit shorter&mdash;pages to find what they need?

        <p> In the trade-off between hiding content below the fold or spreading it across several pages, users have greater success when the content is on a single page. However, if you&rsquo;re going to go with longer pages, you&rsquo;d better make sure that your users can easily find the information they need. </p>

      <p>Alphabetizing content is  rarely a good idea. It is successful when the information has stable naming conventions,  like people's names, or geographical locations. All other information is best  organized by priority, importance, or popularity. </p>
      <p>If  the user is unsure which letter their desired information falls under, then his  or her experience with your content is the same as if it were in random order.</p>
      <blockquote class="mrgn-bttm-lg">

        <p>Where it falls apart is for things where users may not know the  exact wording. In that instance...they must scan  every link to make sure they can see what is relevant and what isn't. <strong>The moral of the story: Unless you can be absolutely sure that users  will know the exact terms in your list, alphabetical order is just  random order.</strong> </p>
