<h1 property="name" id="wb-cont" class="gc-thickline">Make corrections after filing</h1>

<p>It is the obligation of the taxpayer, the employer and the payee to report the income accurately. The employer can correct a <strong>reporting error</strong>.</p>
<p> The employer <strong>cannot change the nature of the income paid </strong>(for example, from salary to dividends). This is considered retroactive tax planning and is viewed as inaccurately changing the reporting of the income.</p>


<h2 id="error">Correct deduction errors in a previous tax year </h2>
		 
		 
<h2 id="amend">Amend, cancel, add, or replace slips and returns</h2>
 <p>Generally, there is no time limit to amend T4 slips. When you file T4 slips, the amounts reported for CPP, EI and income tax are deemed to have been deducted, and <strong>do not </strong>fall under the "statute barred" rules. </p>
