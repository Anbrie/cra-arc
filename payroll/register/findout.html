<h1 property="name" id="wb-cont" class="gc-thickline">Determine if you need to register</h1>
<p>You may need to register a payroll account if you are an  employer, a trustee or a payer of other amounts related to employment.</p>
<details>
			<summary>What is considered an employer, a trustee or a payer of other amounts</summary>
			<h3 id="h_1">What is considered an employer, a trustee or a payer</h3>
<h4 id="h_1_1">Employer</h4>
<p>We generally consider you to be an employer if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>pay salaries, wages (including advances), bonuses, vacation pay, or tips to your employees </li>
<li>provide certain taxable benefits to your employees (for example, an automobile or allowances) </li>
</ul>
<p>An individual is an employee if the worker and the payer have an employer-employee relationship. This relationship is referred to as employment under a <strong>contract of service</strong>.</p>
<p>Although the intent of a written contract might mean that an individual is self-employed (and therefore working under a <strong>contract for services</strong>), we cannot consider the individual as self-employed if there is evidence of an employer-employee relationship.</p>
<h4 id="h_1_2">Trustee</h4>
<h5>Employment by a trustee</h5>
<p>A trustee includes a liquidator, a receiver, a receiver-manager, a trustee in bankruptcy, an assignee, an executor, an administrator, a sequestrator, or any other person who performs a function similar to the one a trustee performs.</p>
<p>A trustee does both of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>authorizes a payment or causes a payment to be made for another person </li>
<li>administers, manages, distributes, winds up, controls, or otherwise deals with another person's property, business, estate, or income </li>
</ul>
<p>The trustee is jointly and severally, or solidarily, liable for deducting and remitting the income tax, Canada Pension Plan contributions, and employment insurance premiums for all payments the trustee makes.</p>
<h5>Trustee in bankruptcy</h5>
<p>The trustee in bankruptcy is the agent of a bankrupt employer in the event of an employer's liquidation, assignment, or bankruptcy. If a bankrupt employer has deducted CPP contributions, EI premiums, or income tax from amounts employees received before the bankruptcy but has not remitted these amounts to us, the trustee must hold the amounts in trust. These amounts are not part of the estate in bankruptcy and should be kept separate.</p>
<p>If a trustee continues to operate the bankrupt employer's business, the trustee must get a new business number. The trustee has to continue to deduct and remit the necessary CPP contributions, EI premiums, and income tax according to the bankrupt employer's remittance schedule. The trustee should prepare and file T4 information returns (slips) in the usual way.</p>
<h5>All other trustees</h5>
<p>If a trustee continues to operate the employer's business, the trustee needs a new business number. The trustee has to continue to deduct and remit the necessary CPP contributions, EI premiums, and income tax according to the employer's remittance schedule. Fees paid to executors, liquidators, or administrators are either income from office or employment <strong>or </strong>business income, depending on whether the executor or administrator acts in this capacity in the regular course of business.</p>
<h4 id="h_1_3">Payer of other amounts related to employment</h4>
<p>A payer of other amounts can be an employer, a trustee, an estate executor, a liquidator, an administrator, or a corporate director who pays other types of income related to an employment. This income can include:</p>

<ul>
<li>pension or superannuation </li>
<li>lump-sum payments </li>
<li>self-employed commissions </li>
<li>annuities </li>
<li>retiring allowances </li>
<li>patronage allowances </li>
<li>accumulated income payments (AIPs) </li>
<li>educational assistance payments (EAPs) </li>
<li>fees or other amounts for services </li>
<li>other income such as: research grants, payments from a Registered disability savings plan (RDSP), wage-loss replacement plan payments if you were not required to withhold Canada Pension Plan (CPP) contributions and employment insurance (EI) premiums, death benefits, or certain benefits paid to partnerships or shareholders </li>
</ul>

                </ul>
<h3>When to register</h3>
<p>You have to register for a payroll program account <strong>before the first remittance due date</strong>. Your first remittance due date is the 15th day of the month following the month in which you began withholding deductions from your employee's pay, unless the CRA tells you to remit using a different frequency.</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
	<li>
		<details>
			<summary>Example 1</summary>
			<p>You hire an employee on March 11 and you pay him bi-weekly. The first pay is on the 25th, therefore your first remittance due date would be April 15.</p>

		</details>
	</li>
	<li>
		<details>
			<summary>Example 2</summary>
			<p>You hire an employee on March 25 and pay him on April 3. Your first remittance due date would be May 15.</p>

		</details>
	</li>
	
</ul>



<h3>What if you do not register</h3>
<p>If you didn't open an account before hiring employees, you <strong>still need to calculate deductions and remit them by the due date</strong>. If you don't, you may be assessed a penalty.</p>
<h3 id="h_0_2">You are not an employer, a trustee or a payer of other amounts related to employment. </h3>
<p><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li"></span> You are <strong>not </strong>required to register for a payroll account because you are not considered an employer, a trustee or a payer of other amounts related to employment. This means that you are <strong>not </strong>required to either:</p>

<ul>
<li>withhold and remit source deductions </li>
<li>file T4, T4A or other information slips  </li>
</ul>
<p>However, you are required to register if you begin to do either. </p>
<h2 id="h_0_3">You do not know if you are an employer, a trustee or a payer of other amounts related to employment. </h2>
<p>You can ask for a CPP/EI ruling on employment status. If you or a person working for you is not sure of the worker's employment status (employee or self-employed), either one of you can request a CPP/EI ruling to determine the status and whether the employment is pensionable, insurable, or both. The ruling can also determine if the earnings are pensionable, insurable, or both. </p>
