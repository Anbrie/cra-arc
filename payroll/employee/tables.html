<h1 property="name" id="wb-cont" class="gc-thickline">Determine which tax tables to use</h1>
<p>When employers or payers pay employment income such as salaries, wages, or commissions, the individuals's province or territory of employment (POE) must be determined so that the proper income tax deductions are withheld. This depends on whether the individual physically (in person) reports at the employer's or payer's establishment.</p>
<details><summary>CRA's mandate - Administering provincial and territorial personal income tax</summary>
<p><strong>CRA's mandate </strong>is to <strong>administer </strong>provincial and territorial personal income tax as legislated by the province or territory. Any concerns regarding the tax policy of a province or territory should be directed to the applicable provincial or territorial Ministry of Finance.</p>

                <p>An <strong>establishment of the employer or payer</strong> is <strong>any place or premises in Canada </strong>that is owned, leased or rented by an employer or payer where individuals report to work or from which individuals are paid.

<h2 id="h-2">Step 1 - Determine the residency status</h2>
<p>The individual, employer or payer may be uncertain of their residency status. </p>
<p>Residency status is determined on a case by case basis and an individual's whole situation. All relevant facts provided by the taxpayer to the CRA in <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/nr73.html">NR73</a>, Determination of residency status (leaving Canada) and <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/nr74.html">NR74</a>, Determination of residency status (entering Canada) must be considered. This includes looking at their <strong>residential ties with Canada</strong>, their intentions and the length of time, purpose and continuity of stays in Canada or abroad. For more information, see <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/international-non-residents/information-been-moved/determining-your-residency-status.html">Determining your residency status</a>.</p>

<h3>How to ask for a binding determination</h3>
<p>To obtain certainly and require a binding determination about the tax consequences of the proposed departure from or arrival in Canada, a person may ask the <strong>Income Tax Rulings Directorate (ITRD) </strong>to issue a binding advance income tax ruling with respect to the residency status of the person. The taxpayer may have to pay a fee to have ITRD complete such a request. For more information on how to ask for an advance income tax ruling, see <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/ic70-6.html">Information Circular IC 70-6R9, Advance Income Tax Rulings and Technical Interpretations</a> or <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/tax-professionals/income-tax-rulings-interpretations.html">Income tax rulings and interpretations</a>.</p>
