    <h2 id="h-4">Background</h2>
    <p>85% of  Canadians work as employees,  as opposed to being self-employed or running a business. In Canada's tax  system, these individuals will have income tax and other contributions to  social programs taken directly off their pay by their employer.</p>
    <p>These  social programs include: </p>
    <dl>
      <dt data-ajax-after"glossary.html #cpp>dd">The Canada Pension Plan (CPP)</dt>
      <dt data-ajax-after"glossary.html #qpp>dd">Quebec Pension Plan (QPP)</dt>
      <dt data-ajax-after"glossary.html #mplmntnsrnc>dd">Employment Insurance (EI)</dt>
      </dl>
    <h2 id="h-5">Warm up exercises</h2>
    <h3>First exercise</h3>
    <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Explain to students that whether they are starting their first job or have been  working for many years, the basic components of starting a new job do not  change. </p>
    <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Ask  students if they have already worked for an employer or a company, as opposed  to babysitting or odd jobs. For those that answer yes, ask what they remember  about being hired. </p>
  <div class="mrgn-lft-md">
    <p>Suggested answers could be:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Providing their social insurance number</li>
          <li>Filling out tax forms</li>
          <li>Giving their banking information for direct deposit</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h3>Second exercise</h3>
    <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Inform  students that one of the most common taxes that we pay in Canada is income tax.  For the majority of individuals, this is taken directly off of their pay by  their employer. This is known as a payroll deduction.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Ask  students if they know of any other amounts that are deducted from their pay.</p>
  <div class="mrgn-lft-md">
    <p>Suggested answers could be:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>CPP/QPP contributions</li>
          <li>EI premiums</li>
          <li>Québec Parental Insurance Plan (QPIP) premiums</li>
          <li>Union dues</li>
          <li>Health plan premiums</li>
          <li>Private pension plan contributions</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Allow students a few minutes to write down why they think payroll deductions  are important. Ask them to keep these in mind as they review the next lesson pages. </p>
    <h2 id="h-6">Learning and activities</h2>
  <p>Read  through the lesson pages with the additional guidance provided below. Students  can review material individually, in groups, or as a class.   </p>
    <h3>Lesson 1: Why you need a SIN or  tax number</h3>
    <p><strong>Activity:</strong> Advise  students that all individuals in Canada require a SIN to work or to receive  benefits and services from the government. Depending on their residency  status  and their citizenship  status,  they may receive a permanent or a temporary SIN. An individual's number usually  stays with them indefinitely. </p>
    <details>
              <summary>Residency status</summary>
              <dl>
                <dt data-ajax-after="glossary.html #rsdncstts>dd" class="wb-inv">Residency status</dt>
              </dl>
	</details>
	<details class="mrgn-bttm-lg">
              <summary>Citizenship status</summary>
              <dl>
                <dt data-ajax-after="glossary.html #ctznshpstts>dd" class="wb-inv">Citizenship status</dt>
              </dl>
	</details>
	<p><strong>Activity:</strong> Stress  to students the importance of keeping their SIN safe. Discuss the implications  of a compromised SIN, such as fraud or identity theft, and the long term  impacts that this can have. </p>
    <h3>Lesson 2: When to fill out a TD1,  Personal Tax Credits Return</h3>
    <p><strong>Activity:</strong> Inform  students that they will need complete a TD1 whenever they start a new job. As  discussed previously, their employer will take income tax off of their pay. The  TD1 allows their employer to complete this calculation accurately based on  their personal tax situation. </p>
    <p><strong>Activity:</strong> Explain  that, in Canada, the income tax that they owe on their income is calculated  when they do their taxes, using information like their taxable income and the tax credits  they're entitled to. Their employer will, ideally, withhold enough tax to cover  the taxes they owe on their income at the end of the year. This is why it's  important to complete the TD1 accurately: to ensure that the correct amount of  tax is withheld – no more, no less. </p>
 <details class="mrgn-bttm-lg">
              <summary>Tax credits</summary>
              <dl>
                <dt data-ajax-after="glossary.html #txcrd>dd" class="wb-inv">Tax credits</dt>
              </dl>
	</details>
	<p><strong>Activity:</strong> Display the <strong>federal TD1</strong> to the class and review the list of personal tax  credits that can be claimed. Ask students which tax credits they think they  might be able to claim, either currently or in future years. </p>
    <h3>Lesson 3: What is on your pay  stub</h3>
    <p><strong>Activity:</strong> Discuss  the concept of payroll with students. Explain that their employer will first  calculate their pay based on the hours they work and their wage, and will then  calculate what amounts to take off. As previously mentioned, the most common  deduction is income tax, which is calculated based on their income and the TD1  that they submit. Other amounts will also be deducted, such as CPP/QPP  contributions and EI premiums, and these amounts are calculated as a  pre-determined percentage of their income. Advise that their employer will make  a matching contribution to these programs on their behalf.</p>
  <p><strong>Activity:</strong> Watch the <strong>Understanding your pay stub video</strong> in part 3 of 5 of the lesson. Ask students to look back at the notes they  took during the warm up and to compare them to what they learned in the video.  Share some of their ideas about why payroll deductions are important. Highlight  that their contributions to social programs make these programs possible and  help fund the future payments they may receive from these programs. Inform  students that they can also claim tax credits for these amounts when they do  their taxes.</p>
  <p><strong>Activity:</strong> Ask  students what would happen if their employer did not take income tax off of  their pay, and what this might mean for individuals earning income through odd  jobs where tax is not automatically deducted, such as babysitting or mowing the  lawn. Inform them that the full amount of taxes they owe on their income would  need to be paid when they do their taxes, as opposed to paying it gradually  over the course of the year.</p>
    <h3>Lesson 4: What is on your T4</h3>
  <p><strong>Activity:</strong> Advise  students that the T4 slip is one of the most common documents they will use  when they do their taxes. It provides a history of their employment income and  deductions for the entire year, similar to the &ldquo;year-to-date&rdquo; information found  on their paystub. </p>
    <h2 id="h-7">Bring it all together</h2>
    <p>Direct  students to complete the quiz to assess their understanding. </p>
    <p>Discuss  the connection between their employment earnings and the tax return that they  will complete every year:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use their SIN to identify themselves with the CRA when they do their  taxes</li>
      <li>Have the option of claiming the tax credits shown on the TD1 on their tax  return</li>
      <li>Report the employment income they earned, as the taxes that they may owe  are calculated using their income</li>
      <li>Claim tax credits for certain payroll deductions, such as CPP/QPP  contributions and EI premiums, to help lower the taxes they owe</li>
      <li>Use their pay stubs to confirm the accuracy of their T4 slip. They will  then use their T4 to report their earnings when they do their taxes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Reconfirm  that the information learned will be useful to students when they start to work  in Canada, but that the same concepts will still apply once they have been  working for many years.</p>
