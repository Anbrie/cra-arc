<p>For purposes of the tax exemption under section 87 of the Indian Act, the term <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/payroll/payroll-deductions-contributions/special-situations/indian-employees.html#dfntns">Indian</a> is used because it has a legal meaning in the Indian Act. Section 87 of the Indian Act exempts from taxation the personal property of an Indian situated on a reserve. The section 87 exemption only applies to an Indian as defined by the Indian Act. It does not apply to all Indigenous Peoples in Canada such as the Inuit or Métis. </p>
<p>You must report all income and deductions on a T4 or T4A slip for status Indian employees regardless of whether their income is taxable or exempt. </p>
<details><summary>Terms used on this page</summary>
<h4>Employer is resident on a reserve</h4>
<p>"Employer is resident on a reserve" means that the reserve is the place where the central management and control over the employer organization is actually located.</p>
<p>The central management and control of an organization is usually considered to be exercised by the group that performs the function of a board of directors of the organization. However, it may be that the real management and control of an organization is exercised by some other person or group. Generally, management and control is exercised at the principal place of business but it is recognized that this function may be legitimately exercised in a place other than the principal administrative office of the organization. It is a question of fact where the central management and control is exercised.</p>
<h4>Indian</h4>
<p>"Indian" means an Indian as defined for the purposes of the Indian Act.</p>
<h4>Indian lives on the reserve</h4>
<p>"Indian lives on the reserve" means the Indian lives on the reserve in a domestic establishment that is his or her principal place of residence and that is the centre of his or her daily routine.</p>
<h4>On a reserve</h4>
<p>"On a reserve" means on a reserve as defined for purposes of the Indian Act, including any settlements deemed to be reserves for purposes of the Indian Settlements Remission Order, and any other areas given similar treatment under federal legislation (for example, Category I-A lands under the Cree-Naskapi" (of Quèbec) Act).</p>
<h4>Social, cultural, educational or economic development</h4>
<p>"Social, cultural, educational or economic development" includes the provision of social services such as health care or counselling.</p>

<h2 id="h_1">Determine the status of the employee</h2>
<p>An Indian is defined in the Indian Act as an individual who is listed or is entitled to be listed in the Indian Register. The Indian Register is the official record identifying all Indians who are registered in Canada. Indigenous Services Canada is responsible for the Indian Register and is the only one authorized to issue a "certificate of Indian status" to an individual.</p>
<h3>Status situations</h3>
<details><summary>Situation: Your employee is registered as a status Indian under the Indian Act</summary>
<p>Depending on your situation, the employment income of status Indians may be exempt from tax. It is the income that is exempt from tax and not the person. </p>
<p>The rules for CPP and EI are different. EI premiums are always required and income that is exempt from income tax is not pensionable employment although you or the employee may elect into the plan.</p>
<p>To determine if the income is exempt from tax in this situation, continue to: <a href="#h_2">Determine the residency of the employee or employer</a>.</p>

<details><summary>Situation: Your employee is a treaty beneficiary of a First Nation with a final or self-government agreement that ends the tax exemption under section 87 of the Indian Act</summary>
<p>The <strong>employment income is taxable</strong> if your employee is a treaty beneficiary of a First Nation with a final or <a href="https://www.rcaanc-cirnac.gc.ca/eng/1100100032275/1529354547314">self-government</a> agreement that ends the tax exemption under section 87 of the Indian Act.</p>
<p>You need to deduct CPP, EI and income tax in this situation, same as your regular employees.</p>

<p>Some First Nations have signed an agreement with the government of Canada to become self-governing Nations. As a result, even though they have Indian status, their members <strong>gave up their tax exemption </strong>provided by section 87 of the Indian Act.</p>
<ul>
<li>Members of such First Nations are usually taxed on their income in the same manner as other Canadians. </li>
<li>They are asked to identify themselves on the first page of their tax return as residing on a settlement land of an Aboriginal government at the end of the year. They are also asked to confirm whether they are citizens or members of these Indigenous governments. Such details are necessary when part of their federal, provincial or territorial tax is transferred to their Indigenous government in accordance with the agreement.  </li>

<h3 id="h_2_1">Residency situations</h3>

<details><summary>Situation: Your employee lives on a reserve and you are a resident on a reserve </summary>
<h4>Exempt income situation</h4>
<p>The CRA's administrative policy applies if the individual's income qualifies for the exemption under section 87 of the Indian Act of the Indian Act and if <strong>all </strong>of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>employee is registered as a status Indian under the Indian Act </li>
<li>employee is <strong>not </strong>a treaty beneficiary of a First Nation with a final or self-government agreement that ends the tax exemption under section 87 of the Indian Act </li>
<li>employee lives on a reserve, this means it is their principal place of residence and is the centre of their daily routine </li>
<li>employer is a resident on a reserve, this means the reserve is the place where the central management and control over the employer organization is actually located </li>
</ul>
<p>You <strong>do not </strong>deduct CPP, EI and income tax in this situation. This includes employment-related income such as unemployment benefits, retiring allowances, and other pensions.</p>

<details><summary>Examples of where exempt and not exempt</summary>
<h4>Examples where exempt</h4>
<p>Mrs. H works for a logging company that is resident on a reserve. Mrs. H lives on a reserve, but performs the duties at lumber camps located off the reserve. The employment income is exempt from income tax because the place where the employee lives and the residence of their employer are factors connecting the income to a reserve.</p>
<p>Mr. I is a construction worker employed by a construction company that is resident on a reserve, to work on building sites that are not located on a reserve. Mr. I lives on a reserve, except for short periods each year when he lives near the construction sites. When away from the reserve, he retains his residence on the reserve where his family lives. Mr. I is exempt from income tax on his employment income because the place where he lives and the residence of his employer are factors connecting his employment income to a reserve.</p>
<h4>Examples where not exempt</h4>
<p>Ms. J lives on a reserve and works as an accountant at the head office of a bank located off a reserve in a nearby city. The bank maintains a branch on Ms. J's reserve and arranges for her to be paid at that branch. Ms. J's employment income is taxable because the only substantive factor linking her employment income to a reserve is her residence which, without other substantial connecting factors, does not result in exemption. Payment on the reserve is viewed as a connecting factor of relatively little weight.</p>
<p>Mr. K is a construction worker employed by a corporation situated on a reserve. The corporation is an employment agency that makes employees available to work for clients that are not situated on a reserve, on building sites not located on a reserve. Mr. K lives on a reserve. The employment agency had an office on the reserve, but carried out very few of its business activities on the reserve. The guidelines would not apply in this case, and one must therefore do an analysis of the connecting factors. Mr. K's employment income is taxable because the residence of the employer in this case has little weight as a connecting factor. The only other substantive factor connecting Mr. K's employment income to a reserve is his residence, which is not sufficient to bring the employment income within the exemption.</p>
<p>Ms. B lives on a reserve and works as director general on that reserve for their corporation (of which they are a shareholder). Their administrative offices are located on that reserve but whose work is carried on mostly off a reserve. Ms. B receives a salary from their corporation. This salary is exempt. Ms. B pays themselves a bonus on top of their salary which bonus is based on the company's performance. The connecting factor of the bonus is not sufficient to bring that income within the exemption.</p>
</details>

<p>Where an employee is a shareholder who controls the business (non-arm's length with the corporation), the source of the business income may be relevant in determining whether the s.87 tax exemption applies to the income received in their capacity as an employee. Where the source of the business income in this situation is off the reserve, the employment income (salary and bonuses) will not be considered to be connected to the reserve and will not be exempt from tax. </p>

<details><summary>Situation: Your employee normally lives on a reserve and you normally are a resident on a reserve for the period of March 15, 2020 to December 31, 2022 <span class="label label-info">CRA's temporary COVID administrative policy</span></summary>
<h4>Exempt income situation</h4>
<p>Under the temporary CRA's temporary administrative policy for the period of Mar 15, 2020 to Dec 31, 2022 applies when your employee usually resides on a reserve and returns to their home as soon as the restrictions are lifted. The CRA's temporary administrative policy also applies when you become resident off a reserve, as long as the central management and control was clearly and generally established on a reserve before the workplace restrictions. The individual's income qualifies for the exemption under section 87 of the Indian Act if <strong>all </strong>of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>employee is registered as a status Indian under the Indian Act </li>
<li>employee is <strong>not </strong>a treaty beneficiary of a First Nation with a final or self-government agreement that ends the tax exemption under section 87 of the Indian Act </li>
<li>employer normally resides on a reserve but the COVID-19 restrictions resulted in the location where the corporation's central management and control over the employer organization having moved off a reserve </li>
<li>employee normally lives on a reserve but is restricted from returning to their home on a reserve due to COVID-19 (this means it was their principal place of residence and was the centre of their daily routine) </li>
</ul>

<p>You <strong>do not </strong>deduct CPP, EI and income tax in this situation. This includes employment-related income such as unemployment benefits, retiring allowances, and other pensions.</p>

<p>Where employees, who normally live on-reserve, are staying in off-reserve housing only because of the territorial restrictions, the employees will be considered resident on a reserve for the exemption. </p>
<p>Where an employer, who normally is a resident on a reserve, and the central management and control is moved off a reserve, the employer will be considered a resident for the exemption. Determinations of employer residency, involving multiple factors, should be determined on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<details><summary>Situation: Other situations where your employee is required to perform duties on a reserve</summary>
<p>Depending on your situation, the employment income of status Indians may be exempt or partly exempt from tax. It is the income that is exempt from tax and not the person. </p>
<p>The rules for CPP and EI are different. EI premiums are always required and income that is exempt from income tax is not pensionable employment although you or the employee may elect into the plan.</p>

<h4>Exempt income situation: Your employee performs more than 50% of their employment duties on a reserve</h4>
<p>Under the CRA's administrative policy, if the employee performs more than 50% of their employment duties on a reserve, the individual's income qualifies for the exemption if <strong>all </strong>of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>employee is registered as a status Indian under the Indian Act </li>
<li>employee is <strong>not </strong>a treaty beneficiary of a First Nation with a final or self-government agreement that ends the tax exemption under section 87 of the Indian Act  </li>

<details><summary>Example where exempt or not exempt</summary>
<h4>Example where exempt</h4>
<p>Ms. L lives on a reserve and works as a policewoman for an off-reserve employer. She performs more than one-half of her duties on reserve, and she has an additional connecting factor in that she lives on the reserve. Therefore, she is exempt on the whole of the employment income.</p>
<h4>Example where not exempt</h4>
<p>Ms. M lives off a reserve in a town where she works in a restaurant owned by a corporation resident on a reserve. Once a week, she drives to the reserve to pick up the pay cheques for the restaurant staff. The whole of her employment income is taxable because the only factor connecting the income to a reserve is the residence of the employer and, without other connecting factors, this is not sufficient for the exemption to apply.</p>
</details>

<h4>Partly-exempt income: Your employee performs 50% or less of their employment duties on a reserve</h4>
<p>Under the CRA's administrative policy, if the employee performs 50% or less of their employment duties on a reserve, the exemption may be prorated and those duties are not merely incidental to duties they performed off a reserve. The exemption will apply only to the portion of the income related to the duties the employee performed on the reserve and if <strong>all </strong>of the following apply: </p>

<ul>
<li>employee is registered as a status Indian under the Indian Act </li>
<li>employee is <strong>not </strong>a treaty beneficiary of a First Nation with a final or self-government agreement that ends the tax exemption under section 87 of the Indian Act  </li>
<li>the employer <strong>or </strong>the employee is in one of the following situation:

<li>employee lives on a reserve, this means it is their principal place of residence and is the centre of their daily routine </li>
<li>employer is a resident on a reserve, this means the reserve is the place where the central management and control over the employer organization is actually located </li>

<h5>Examples where exempt</h5>
<p>Mr. E lives off a reserve and works for a government department, mostly at a location off a reserve. He spends one-half day per week on a regular basis working in a clinic on a reserve. Since one- tenth of Mr. E's work is performed on a reserve, 10% of Mr. E's income from this employment is exempt.</p>
<p>Ms. F lives off a reserve and works for a boys and girls club at a location off a reserve. Each summer, Ms. F works for the club at a one-month camp operated on a reserve. The income Ms. F earns at the summer camp is exempt.</p>
<h5>Example where not exempt</h5>
<p>Mrs. G lives off a reserve and works for a stationery store located off a reserve. On rare occasions, Mrs. G delivers some of the store's goods to customers on reserve. None of her income is exempt. The trips to the reserve are merely occasional and are not a meaningful connecting factor.</p>

<h4>Exempt income situation: Your employee normally performs more than 50% of their employment duties on a reserve</h4>
<p>Under the temporary CRA's administrative policy, if the employee performs more than 50% of their employment duties on a reserve for the period of March 15, 2020 to December 31, 2022, the individual's income qualifies for the exemption if <strong>all </strong>of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>employee is registered as a status Indian under the Indian Act </li>
<li>employee is <strong>not </strong>a treaty beneficiary of a First Nation with a final or self-government agreement that ends the tax exemption under section 87 of the Indian Act  </li>

<li>employee normally lives on a reserve but is restricted from returning to their home on a reserve due to COVID-19 (this means it was their principal place of residence and was the centre of their daily routine) </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>employee who usually performed more than 50% part of their duties of employment from their regular place of employment on a reserve before the COVID-19 workplace restrictions, now has to telework from a home office off a reserve solely because of those restrictions </li>
<li>employee must work at the on-reserve location as soon as the restrictions are lifted </li>
</ul>
<p>Where employees have been working off a reserve <strong>only </strong>because of the workplace restrictions, the temporary policy considers the days during which the employee worked off-reserve only. This is for calculating the percentage of employment duties performed on a reserve for the 50% requirement.</p>

<details><summary>Example where exempt or not exempt</summary>
<h5>Examples where exempt</h5>
<p>Mr. N works for the education department of a tribal council at an off-reserve location central to several reserves. Mr. N lives off a reserve and the tribal council is resident on one of the reserves. Mr. N is exempt from income tax on his employment income because the duties he performs for the tribal council are connected to the reserves served by the council, and the employer is resident on a reserve.</p>
<p>Ms. O is a librarian working for a technical training institute operated by five Indian bands for Indians who live on a reserve. The administrative office of the institute is on a reserve. Ms. O lives off a reserve and works at an off-reserve location central to several reserves. Ms. O is exempt from income tax on her employment income because the duties she performs for the Indian organization that employs her are connected to the reserves served by the Indian organization, and the employer is resident on a reserve.</p>
<p>Mr. P works for an Indian organization providing child and family related services to members of a large number of bands with reserves scattered over a large area within a province. Some of these services are provided in the provincial capital, where Mr. P works, and the organization's administrative office is at an off-reserve location central to the bands served. However, the organization's directors, consisting of the band chiefs, meet at each reserve in rotation. Mr. P is exempt from income tax on his employment income because the duties he performs for the Indian organization that employs him are connected to the reserves served by the Indian organization, and the employer is resident on a reserve.</p>
<p>Ms. Q works for a company that is resident on a reserve and owned by a tribal council. The company exists to provide adequate low-cost housing on reserves and the company's property is for the most part on reserves. Ms. Q performs her duties at an off-reserve location central to several reserves. Ms. Q is exempt from income tax on her employment income because the duties she performs for the Indian organization that employs her are connected to the reserves served by the Indian organization, and the employer is resident on a reserve.</p>
<p>Mr. R works for an Indian organization that manages funds provided by the government to assist in planning for future education needs on reserves. His employer is resident on a reserve, but he works at a location off a reserve. Mr. R is exempt from income tax on his employment income because the duties he performs for the Indian organization that employs him are connected to the reserves served by the Indian organization, and the employer is resident on a reserve.</p>
<h5>Examples where not exempt</h5>
<p>Mr. S works for a commercial building supplies company that is owned by a tribal council and is resident on a reserve. He performs his duties off a reserve and lives off a reserve. Mr. S is taxable on his employment income because, although there is one factor, the residence of the employer, connecting the income to a reserve, this factor by itself is not sufficient to confer the exemption when the employer and the employee are active in the commercial mainstream of society.</p>
<p>Ms. T works for an Indian organization dedicated to organizing social programs for off-reserve Indians. The organization is located off a reserve. Ms. T is taxable on her employment income because there are no factors connecting that income to a location on a reserve.</p>
