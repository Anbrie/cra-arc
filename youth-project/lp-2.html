      <p>Read through the lesson pages with the additional guidance provided below. Students can review material individually, in groups, or as a class.   </p>
      <h4>Lesson A: Documents you will need</h4>
      <h5>Before starting the lesson</h5>
      <p>Advise students that when they are doing their tax return, a key piece of personal information to have ready is their social insurance number (SIN). If they have done their taxes before, they might need to gather some more information about their tax account with the CRA. They can find these pieces of information online in My Account, on their notice of assessment  from the previous tax year, or by contacting the CRA.</p>
      
	 <div class="well brdr-rds-0">
        <h5 class="mrgn-tp-0">Activity</h5>
        <p>Display  the federal TD1 form to the class and review the list of personal tax credits  that can be claimed. Ask students which tax credits they think they might be  able to claim, either now or in the future. </p>
      </div>	
		
		
      <h4>Lesson B: Ways to do your taxes</h4>
      <h5>Before starting the lesson</h5>
      <p>Explain that we have different ways to do our taxes in Canada. The most popular way is to file electronically using certified tax software. Explain what certified tax software is and that it can help them do their taxes on their own. Tax software must be certified by the CRA. We keep a list of certified tax software you can use to confirm that your software qualifies.</p>
		
		<p>Stress to the students that there are many free certified tax software packages available to them. However, there are also other ways to do their taxes, like free tax clinics, through tax preparers and on paper. </p>
      <div class="well brdr-rds-0">
        <h5 class="mrgn-tp-0">Activity</h5>
        <p>Separate the class by teams, and then have each team explore 1 of the 7 ways to do their taxes outlined in the lesson. After that, have each team explain the key points of that filing method to the rest of the class, including the pros and cons. Ask the class which way they would choose to file their taxes and why.  </p>
      </div>
      <h4>Lesson C: Important dates</h4>
      <h5>Before starting the lesson</h5>
      <p>Discuss with your students the important dates concerning their taxes. In this lesson, they will learn about the: </p>
    <ul>
	<li>filing due date</li>	
	<li>payment deadline</li>	
	<li>consequences of not knowing about important dates: penalties and interest</li>	
		</ul>
      <div class="well brdr-rds-0">
        <h5 class="mrgn-tp-0">Activity</h5>
        <p>Let’s go on a scavenger hunt. The only thing students will need is a calendar. With the information they have learned in this lesson about the important dates, ask your students to find and discuss their answers to the following questions: </p>
		  
<ul>
		  <li>What is considered a tax season? (mid-February to April).</li>		  
		    <li>What is the filing deadline? (generally it is April 30th of the following year; if you or spouse or common-law partner were self-employed, then it is June 15th)</li>	
		    <li>What happens if it falls on a Saturday or Sunday? (your return is considered on time if the CRA receives it or it is postmarked on the next business day)</li>	
		    <li>If you have an amount owing, what date does the CRA need to receive the payment by? (generally all individuals must pay the amount due by April 30th)</li>
		  </ul>		  
		  
		  
		  
		  
		  
		  
      </div>
		
		
		
		
		
      
    </div>
    <div class="lst-stps-itm">
      <h3 id="h-4-4">Bring it all together<span class="wb-inv"> step 4</span></h3>
      <p>Direct students to complete the quiz to assess their understanding.</p>
      <p>Discuss the importance of being well-prepared to do their taxes.</p>
      <p>Ask the students the following questions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Will they do a checklist of all the documents they need to gather before doing their taxes? 
		  <ul>
			<li>Share with them the key checklist so they can confirm their comprehension.</li>
			
			
			</ul>
		  
		  
		  
		  </li>
        <li>Where can they find their tax slips and carryforward amounts?</li>
        <li>What is the benefit of doing their taxes every year, even when they may have no income?</li>
        
      </ul>
      <p>Reiterate that the information learned will help them to better organize themselves. This helps make doing their taxes quick and easy. Like everything else, it is all in the preparation!</p>
