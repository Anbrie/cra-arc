	     <summary>If your charity is incorporated in Ontario</summary>
	     <p>If your charity is incorporated in Ontario and subject to the Ontario Not-for-profit Corporations Act, you must file an Ontario annual information return. For more information, visit <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/ontario-business-registry#section-6">Ontario Business Registry</a>.</p>

		<summary>If your charity was inactive</summary>
		<p>A charity is inactive if, during the entire fiscal year, it did not use any of its resources to carry out its charitable activities or to further its charitable purposes.</p>
		<p>If your charity was inactive for a fiscal year, you must still file a complete T3010 return and explain why you were inactive in Section C: Question C2. </p>
		<p>If you do not file your return, you risk losing your charitable status.</p>
		<p>If you remain inactive, we may review your file to see if you still qualify for registration.</p>

	      <details>
		      <summary>If your charity is no longer operating</summary>
		      <p>Even if your charity is no longer operating, you must still file an annual T3010 return.</p>
		      <p>If your charity is no longer operating, you should ask for voluntary revocation of your registration. Once revocation is granted, you will no longer have to file a T3010 for any future fiscal period.</p>

		      <ul>
			      <li><b>Fiscal year end change:</b> If you received approval to change your fiscal year-end, you will need to file a separate return for the months between your old fiscal year-end and the beginning of your new fiscal year.</li>
			     <ul>
			      </ul>
			      <li><b>Permission to accumulate funds:</b> If you received approval to accumulate funds, report the amount accumulated during the fiscal year, including any income earned, on line 5500 and any accumulated funds spent on line 5510.</li>
			      <ul>
			      </ul>
			      <li><b>Disbursement quota reduction:</b> If you received approval for a disbursement quota reduction, you must file Form T1240, Registered Charity Adjustment Request, to correct the return for the fiscal year the shortfall occurred in.</li>

	      <h3>If you fail to submit your return</h3>
	      <p>If you do not file your return within 6 months of the end of your fiscal year we will start the revocation process for failure to file.</p>
	      <p>We will send you a T2051A, Notice of Intention to Revoke a Charity's Registration, by registered mail.

		<p>If you do not file an objection or appeal, or if it was unsuccessful, your charitable registration will be revoked. We will send you, by registered mail, a T2051B, Notice of Revocation of a Charity's Registration, which states the effective date of revocation.</p>
	      <p>If your charity's registration is revoked, you:</p>
	      <ul>

         <h2 id="h-1">After you file</h2>
         <p>After you file your T3010 return, we will send you a confirmation of annual information return filing.</p>
