        <div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <p>Between October and December 2017, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> conducted an analysis on the feasibility of this recommendation.</p>
<p>As a result of that analysis, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> expects to be able to implement this recommendation by April 1, 2019. The Agency will need to take the following steps for this to happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>gather data to determine the approximate processing time as well as the amount of time taxpayer relief officers spend on complex requests;</li>
<li>review and where necessary, revise procedures on determining the complexity of requests; and</li>
<li>review and where necessary, revise correspondence templates to:<ul>
<li>advise taxpayers if their request is routine or complex;</li>
<li>provide taxpayers with an accurate estimate of the processing time for their request based on the level of its complexity; and</li>
<li>advise taxpayers when, upon further review, the level of complexity of their request has changed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> began tracking its processing times for complex requests in January 2018. An analysis of the data collected will be completed in Fall 2018, and the results will be used to provide more accurate processing times to taxpayers.</p>
<p>After the completion of this analysis, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> will also be reviewing and revising, as needed, its procedures and correspondence templates. This stage is expected to be completed by the end of March 2019.</p>

        <p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> reviewed its procedures on determining the complexity of taxpayer relief requests and found that its agents are able to correctly identify the level of complexity using existing procedures. Therefore, it was concluded that no changes were required.</p>
<p>On April 1, 2019, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> revised its correspondence templates to:</p>
<ul>
<li>advise taxpayers if their request is routine or complex;</li>

<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> accepts this recommendation. The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> already commenced steps in 2014 for maintaining nation-wide consistency in processing times for relief requests related to the cancellation of penalties and interest.</p>

        <h4>2018 update</h4>
        <div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> has implemented significant enhancements to its existing Appeals workload management system and is working to update its current technologies which will contribute to further improving consistency in processing times for taxpayer relief requests across Canada.</p>
<p>Although a national process related to the movement of files was implemented in 2014, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> is working to improve technologies so that it can move away from that manual process of inventory management towards a more automated process.</p>
<p>In addition to the enhancements to its management system, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> has made the following changes that have resulted in improvements to the processing of taxpayer relief requests:</p>
<ul>
<li>changes to processes and procedures to address high inventory levels;</li>
<li>development of program monitoring and quality assurance processes, to identify issues and discrepancies, promote consistency, and identify gaps and improvements;</li>
<li>introduction on April 1, 2016, of an external service standard (acknowledgement of receipt of request within 30 calendar days) with a commitment to meet this standard 85% of the time;</li>
<li>introduction on April 1, 2017, of a new service standard (processing requests and issuing a decision within 180 calendar days) with a commitment to meet this standard 85% of the time;</li>
<li>sharing of a national process map for intake centre screeners across all regions that is expected to enhance consistency among all intake centres.</li>
</ul>
<p>These improvements have allowed the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> to reduce the processing time for taxpayer relief requests from an average of 15 months in October 2013, to 12 months in January 2015. With the change to the current manual process for inventory management, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> was able to further reduce the processing time to 6 months in October 2015. In the past year, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> processed taxpayer relief requests to cancel or waive penalties and interest within 180 days of receipt, 86.8% of the time.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> has completed a comprehensive review of its business processes for the Taxpayer Relief Program intake centres and continues to work at improving efficiency and consistency across all regions.</p>
<p>A review of the business process for the Centres of Expertise is currently in the planning phase and is expected to further improve consistency as well as reduce processing times. The expected completion date for this review is March 2020.</p>
<p>An e-services project is currently underway to improve <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/rc4288.html">Form RC4288, Request for Taxpayer Relief – Cancel or Waive Penalties or Interest</a>, which will allow taxpayers to submit structured relief requests through the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>’s online portals. The expected completion date for this project is May 2020.</p>

        <p>In April 2019, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> implemented a standardized approach for documenting taxpayer relief decisions.&nbsp;It is expected that this will result in more consistent processing of taxpayer relief requests.</p>
<p>In September 2019, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> will launch a pilot project for the creation of a national inventory, which will increase efficiencies in workload management, reduce regional inventory variations, and ensure a fair and consistent approach to the delivery of service to taxpayers.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> has increased its focus on continuous improvement and service, and is taking the opportunity to review, clarify, and challenge the purpose of its processes. In January 2019, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> held the first national process review event on the processing of taxpayer relief requests.&nbsp;Opportunities for improvement were identified and will be implemented, thereby contributing to maintaining nation-wide consistency.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> intends to launch a pilot in one region to test the identified improvements before the end of December 2019. This will allow the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> to make any necessary modifications prior to national implementation in April 2020.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> will continue to foster a culture of continuous improvement and identify opportunities for enhancements. These ongoing improvements, which include a focus on the needs of taxpayers, are constantly being implemented and will not only maintain, but improve nation-wide consistency in processing times of taxpayer relief requests.&nbsp;As such, the review of the business process for the Centres of Expertise is truly an evergreen process that will continue to evolve moving forward.</p>
<p>The electronic <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/rc4288.html">Form RC4288, Request for Taxpayer Relief – Cancel or Waive Penalties or Interest</a>, will be completed and available to taxpayers through the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> online portals in October 2019.</p>
